                style="font-size: 10pt; color: black;">The overall
                number of students taking the tests has doubled over the
                last 5 years. It is indeed impressive that so many
                students take the AP test each year. Fully 17% of all
                students took at least 1 AP exam last year. Each AP
                student took an average of 2 exams. Do we know how this
                compares to other schools? If would be nice to compare
                this percentage to other schools in general, and also to
                schools with similar demographics.</span></li>

                10pt; color: black;">In each of the last fives years,
                the overall percent of passing scores at Logan has been
                higher than the state average - though that gap has
                narrowed recently. <br>
              </span></li>
            <li><span id="yui_3_16_0_1_1413119759998_247416"
                style="font-size: 10pt; color: black;">The overall
                numbers look pretty good, but there is wide variation by
                subject. Examining the numbers by subject reveals many
                interesting stories (see below). </span><span
                style="color: black;"></span><span style="font-size:

                10pt; color: black;">I wonder how the roll-out of the
                common core will influence these numbers. It's too bad
                we cannot isolate its influence from other factors like
                the roll-out of the chromebooks and other changes.</span></li>
            <li><span id="yui_3_16_0_1_1413119759998_247407"
                style="font-size: 10pt; color: black;">The percent of
                students with AP scores of 3 or better has been dropping
                over the last 4 years (74.3%, &nbsp;71.4%, 67.3%, 66.5%)
                while state averages held steady at about 64%. </span><span
                id="yui_3_16_0_1_1413119759998_247407" style="font-size:
                10pt; color: black;">I'm pretty sure the reason for this
                is increased participation as a result of open
                enrollment. There are more students taking the test now
                than ever, but there has been a corresponding drop in
                scores in most cases. The following chart, from Robert
                Singer, shows the changing distrbution over the 5 years
                for one subject (English). The pattern is very similar
                on other subject.&nbsp; If the drop in scores were only
                from more low scores, then one could assume that open
                enrollment was at least harmless, but the disturbing
                trend is that the highest scores have dropped as well.<br>

                An increasing number of students have been taking the
                test (doubled to 86 over the last 5 years), but there
                has been a slight downward trend over the last 4 years.

                Prior to last year, the annual scores at Logan were
                roughly in line with the nationwide average. Last year,
                however, there was a staggering drop to less than half
                the prior year average. 20 out of the 27 students that
                took the exam got a 1 (the lowest score possible). There
                were triple the number of students taking it last year,
                but they were clearly not prepared - and proabably did
                not even know they were not prepared. None of the
                students got a 5 last year.&nbsp;</span><span

                10pt; color: black;">I know that last year, Ms Banther
                took a different approach to teaching the material. She
                decided to focus on only the A material, rather than the
                the more comprehensive AB (full year) material. I have a
                theory that many of the students found the class easy
                and got good grades, and as a result assumed that they
                would also do well on the AP test. It is a very hard
                test, but nationally, of those that took it, over 50%
                got a 4 or 5.</span><span style="color: black;"></span><span
                style="font-size: 10pt; color: black;"><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last year, I offered to administer a
                free practice CS AP exam through the Computer Science
                Club. Only two students form the AP CS classes attempted
                the practice exam, even though it was widely advertised.
                I will try again this year. It's great that more
                students are taking this exam, but it's critical that
                those taking it are prepared for it. </span><span

                AP test score results between the two teachers should be
                compared. There may not be enough students taking the
                test to make a statistically significant comparison, but
                its a data point to consider.</span><span style="color:

                would have an option to go to a quiet room and take the
                class online. The students pursuing this option would
                still have a chance to ask their teacher for help, and
                they may choose to go to the regular classroom when
                special events are happending, but primarily they would
                satisfy that course's requirements online. The teacher
                can track their progress and intervene if necessary.
                Exams can be proctored by the teacher. Do not quickly
                dismiss this proposal. Online classes have improved
                dramatically over the last few years. The quality of
                instruction and level of interaction with others
                worldwide, is probably much greater than is possible in
                a traditional classroom. For many students, especially
                those that are advanced, an online curriculum allows
                them to proceed much further and faster than otherwise.

                  article</a> gives an overview of how it could work.
                This <a href="https://users-mooc.amplify.com/">online
                  AP Computer Science </a>class is a perfect example of
                what I am talking about. It is free, and only requires a
                "coach" to monitor student progress.</span><span

            <li><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black;">A similar
                option would be a flipped classroom - where the student
                watches interactive lectures by world-class professors
                online at home on their chromebook, and does homework,
                lab work, projects, and group activities in the
                classroom where the teacher can assist.</span><span
                style="color: black;"></span><span style="font-size:
                10pt; color: black;"></span></li>
            <li><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black;">Have an
                introductory programming class before the AP CS class,
                and make the AP CS class much more rigorous so that
                students are well prepared. Students should be able to
                skip the introductory class if they can pass a test to
                place into the AP version.</span><span style="color:
                black;"></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color:
                black;"></span></li>
            <li><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black;">In every
                subject, students should have an opportunity to take a
                practice exam to see how they will do. This exam should
                not happen during class time. The student would take it
                home and it would be later graded by the teacher or
                parent volunteers. Since the score is just for
                informational/preparatory purposes and not a grade,
                there would be no incentive to cheat. Perhaps the
                practice test could be given by parent volunteers under
                simulated conditions.</span><span style="color: black;"></span>

              as a result of having an increasing percentage of students
              take the exam. This may well be a worthwhile trade-off,
              but we should understand the pros and cons. There are two
              points, however, that are incontrovertable in my mind:</span><span

            <li><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black;">Students
                should have some idea of how they will do before they
                take the exam, so that they can make an informed
                decision.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
