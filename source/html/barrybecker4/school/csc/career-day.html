    The following is a speech that I prepared to give to my son's 8th grade class during career day
    at Alvarado Middle School in 2013. However, the school canceled the event because, apparently,
    I was the only parent willing to come in an talk about their career.

<h1>Career Day Presentation (that never happened)</h1>

<p>
I am a software developer. Twenty years ago I worked as a computer
scientist at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory. Since then I have worked at
several different technology companies around the Bay Area. For the
last 7 years I have worked for a software company in Houston Texas. How
is that possible you might wonder? Mostly I telecommute from my home
office, but I occasionally travel to Houston when we start planning a
new software release. The software I build is used to visualize data.
I'm now going to describe how I first became interested in this line of
work back when I was your age.
</p>
<p>When I was in junior high school, there were no personal computers.
I knew they existed because my mother used them where she worked. She
sometimes brought home a teletype machine. This is just a dumb terminal
connected to a mainframe computer. It did not even have a screen.
Instead it printed on a roll of paper! You typed in commands that were
sent to a computer over a modem and the response from the computer was
printed on the paper. It was a tremendous waste of paper, but monitors
were expensive and paper was cheap at the time. By the time I was a
freshman in high school, personal computers were just coming out. I
visited a friend who had an Apple IIe. It had a small monochrome screen
with green green text on a black background, but I was completely
amazed at what it could do. From that point on I knew I wanted to own
one of those magical machines.
</p>
<p>I went to the library, and found that I could borrow a small
computer. By small, I mean really small. It was like a big calculator.
It had a chicklet style keyboard and only 2k of memory. 2k of memory on
a computer is not very much. By way of comparison, today's Smart phones
have about 10 million times as much memory as that. Programs could not
be more than 2000 characters - which is about 1 typed page. My first
program was a loop that would print "hello Barry" ten times, but then I
changed it to a 1000 times. For some reason this fascinated me. Today
you too can go to a library and use a computer for free that is
hundreds of thousands of times more powerful than that Timex Sinclair
that I first used back in the early 1980's.
</p>
<p>I begged my parents for a computer. Since my mother was a programmer
at ATT&amp;T Bell Labs and understood the benefits of computing, it was
not a tough sell. They bought me a TI-99/4a. It had 16k of memory (8
times as much as the library computer). I used a tiny black and white
TV for the monitor, and a cassette tape player for offline storage.
There were no games or other applications for it. It came with only the
BASIC computer language. So I learned BASIC on my own by reading the
big manual that came with the computer. Since there were no games, I
created my own. I spent hours programming it, but the time I spent
programming was more exciting to me than any game I had ever played. I
had seen computer games running on my friends Apple and I had seen
Atari video games like pong or space invaders, but I did not have them
at home - so I tried to create them. I wrote a pong game. I created a
simplistic text-based Sim-City sort of game,&nbsp;Mastermind, and Risk
among others. I created simulations like fractals and random circles
that filled the screen. My mother learned BASIC too, and I was able to
discuss my projects with her. There was never any doubt in my mind that
I wanted to create programs for a living when I grew up.
</p>
<p>I cannot emphasize enough what a brilliant move it was on the part
of my parents not to get me a game console or a computer with lots of
games on it. If I had had the games, that is all I would have done -
play hours of senseless games that someone else created. This is a trap
that most kids with a computer fall into today. It is hard not to
because the games available today are orders of magnitude more
compelling that what was around in my day. It's probably too late, but
I urge you not to fall into this trap. It was an unbelievably
transformative experience for me to create <a href="http://barrybecker4.com/bb4-projects/index.html">my own games and simulations</a>.
The act of creating something is far more satisfying than consuming
someone else's product. In the process of programming, I came to
realize the importance of mathematics, and started doing a lot better
in math at school because I could see how it made my programs better.
Creating even basic computer graphics involves an amazing amount of
trigonometry and higher math.
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.whrhs.org/">
My high school</a> had a computer
lab that was open after school. There were 4 IBM PCs and 8 Apple IIe's.
There were no games on these computers. There was no internet. There
were no graphics - only text. The lab was not crowded. I never had a
problem getting a computer all to myself. My high school had just
started offering computer programming classes and an AP computer
science class. Everything was so new that the teachers were learning to
program at the same time as the students. I was able to skip the
introductory computer classes by taking a test because I had already
learned BASIC on my own. Until that time, I was the only student to do
that. I loved the AP computer class. I can remember I spent one whole
Christmas break implementing 6 different sorting algorithms and
comparing their run time performance graphically. It wasn't homework, I
just really wanted to do it. This was my equivalent of playing computer
games.
</p>
<p>My first job in high school was at an insurance company stuffing
envelopes and answering phones. I did some data entry work too. Data
entry is when you take data from printed paper and type it verbatim
into the computer. Its incredibly tedious (and I was a very slow
typist). This is before scanners were invented. I saw that they had a
need for a mailing list program and created one for them in a computer
language called Turbo Pascal. All it did was print sorted mailing
labels for their customers from a simple text database, but they were
very happy with it and raised my pay. Years later when I was in college
and came back to visit, I was amazed that they were still using the
same program to help run their business.
</p>
<p>Even today, after having programmed for nearly 30 years, I still
love programming as much as I ever did. Although I spend all day
writing software for my employer, I still work on my own computer
projects in my free time. It's more than just a career for me, its a
way of life. The technology changes rapidly and is always surprising,
new, and interesting.
</p>
<p>I can't say that any of you will find a similar calling in computer
programming the way that I did, but the important thing is that
somewhere along the way you find something. At some point in your life
you will find something that you will find deeply meaningful to you and
useful to others. Don't let that moment pass. Do whatever it takes to
follow that passion and see where it leads.
