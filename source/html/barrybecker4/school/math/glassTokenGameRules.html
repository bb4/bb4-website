            I used to call this the glass token game because we used
            little class tokens to represent points. However, over time,
            I reallized we could just keep track of the team scores on
            the whiteboard.<br>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Hand out the problem and give them
                5 minutes to collectively come up with their best
                answer.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Answers
                that are shouted out during this five minutes will be
                ignored.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) At the end of the five minutes
                they need to write 2 things on their small whiteboards:
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) Agree on a
                single answer for their team,
                and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) Write the
                number of points they are willing to wager according
                to&nbsp; how&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                confident that their answer is correct&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                (sort of like betting that they are
                right).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;



                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                They can put 0 stones or all their
                stones.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, if they put in all
                their stones and lose, <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                it will be difficult to recover.&nbsp;&nbsp; If they
                cannot agree on an answer or a number of
                stones,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                their team forfeits the round.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) After the stones are in the cups,
                the teacher will write each team's answer&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; below the
                respective team's name on the board. Then the teacher
                will reveal the&nbsp; correct answer.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a team got
                the wrong answer, all the tokens in their cup are
                collected.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If they got
                it right, they get additional tokens equal to the number
                placed in the cup + 1.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (The +1
                makes it is possible for a team with 0 tokens to
                continue playing) <br>

                of points initially so students feel some pain when they
                give a wrong answer.<br>
                <br>
                We can also take away pointss for talking out of turn if
                needed. We should state up front that if a student
                speaks after we have asked for quiet, then their team
                will lose one point for each infraction.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                <br>
                At the end of the session give a very hard "bonus"
                problem that will be worth an additional two or three
                points for their team if they can find a solution by the
                next meeting. To win the points, however, they must
                clearly explain how they solved the problem in their own
                words and in their own handwriting. So if they were to
                get help from other kids, adults, or books - that is ok
                - because at least they thought about it and took time
                to write out a solution. The problem should be hard
                enough that only a few will do it and have acceptable
                solutions. In addition, we could give points for solving
                in a similar manner any problem that they got wrong on a
                previous math league test.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                <br>
                I thought about giving a prize to the winning team, but
                I'm not sure it is a good idea. Introducing an extrinsic
                motivator might hinder development of a natural desire
                to solve the problems for their own sake.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                <br>
                Some challenge problems given so far: <br>
                &nbsp; - If a brick weighs 9 pounds + 1/2 a brick. How
                much does a brick and a half weigh? <br>
                &nbsp; - Can you tell me 2 numbers, neither of which
                ends in 0, that when multiplied together equal 1000? <br>
                &nbsp; - You have some Amoebas in a dish. Every minute
                their number doubles. After one year, the amoebas cover
                the earth. When did they cover half the earth?<br>
