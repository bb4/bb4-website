                is the information (almost verbatim) that I am sharing
                with the children about probability over the course of
                several weeks.&nbsp; I realize that while probability
                may not be something on the 5th grade curriculum, it is
                closely related to things that are (like fractions), and
                having some exposure to it should be a good thing. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I realize that gambling may be
                a controversial subject to discuss with the children.
                Let the record show that I am in no way encouraging them
                to gamble (quite the opposite is true). Gambling, for
                better or worse, is a big part of our lives, and I
                believe it is better to approach it with open eyes and
                understanding rather than ignorance. Gambling is not
                limited to what happens in a casino. Playing the lottery
                and the stock market are also forms of gambling and can
                provide very different lessons.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm trying to take an iterative
                approach. That is, explain some things, then test, then
                explain more and test things already tested, plus some
                new things. I also have ideas for some probabilistic
                games that they can play. Much of the info here I got
                from the excellent book "Struck by Lightning: the
                curious world of probabilities" by Rosenthal<br>

                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Probability plays a big role in
                almost everything we do or that happens to us. For
                example, when you get in a car or an airplane there is a
                small probability you will be involved in a crash. It is
                actually good that there is so much randomness, because
                our lives would be boring without it. Imagine how your
                life would be if you always knew exactly what was going
                to happen and how frustrating it would be if&nbsp; there
                was nothing you could do to change it. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A lot of games involve probability to
                a greater or lesser degree. Chutes and ladders is purely
                luck because each move is entirely determined by the
                roll of a die. Monopoly has a large component of luck,
                but also involves a surprising amount of skill because
                of all the decisions that you have to make while
                playing. Understanding probability will help you be a
                much better monopoly player. Then there are other games
                like checkers, chess, and go which have no luck
                involved. These games are said to have perfect
                information. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember playing monopoly with
                Brian one time. He had all the railroads and a lot of
                cash. I had 3 purples, but not much cash. I knew that if
                play continued with no change, it was a certainty I
                would lose. So I took a chance and mortgaged all my
                other properties to buy houses on the purple properties.
                There was only a small chance of him landing there
                before I landed on more railroads. But having a small
                chance of victory quickly (say 25%) if he landed on my
                houses was better than facing certain defeat in the long
                run by gradually losing money. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; When you shoot a basketball, what is the
                probability that you make a basket? You can figure it
                out by trying it 100 times and see how many times you
                are successful. The number of times you make it divided
                by the number of times you tried tells you your expected
                likely hood of success on any given chance. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; Let us consider gambling at a casino. It is
                clearly something that involves a lot of chance. Do you
                all know about roulette? There is a wheel with 38 spaces
                for a marble to fall in. Two of the spaces are purple,
                but the rest are black or red. You can bet on black or
                red or individual numbers, but if the marble lands in
                the purple spots the casino wins. So if you bet on red,
                what is your probability of winning? (18/38 or 47%). <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; Suppose you borrowed $10,000 from the mob,
                and if you do not pay it back by tomorrow they are going
                to break both your legs. You have one night to gamble on
                roulette in the casino what should you do? Should you
                make one big bet or lots of little one? why? <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; Gambling is not something I recommend that
                you ever do, but if you must you should at least
                understands the probabilities involved so that at least
                you will not lose as much as you might otherwise. The
                casino will always win in the long run even though on
                any individual wager the can win or loose. The reason
                they always win is because all the odds are just
                slightly in their favor and in the long run they will
                always win a certain percentage of the total amount bet.
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; If you consider betting 10 dollars on black
                in roulette, you win about half the time, but because of
                the 2 purple spaces, on average the hours will take 52
                cents out of every 10 dollar wager you make. You could
                have a fantastic winning streak where you win 10 times
                in a row, but if you play all night, you are guaranteed
                to loose approximately 5% of the total amount that you
                bet. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; If Magic Johnson challenged me to a free
                throw competition and said if I can make more free
                throws than him in 5 shots at the basket, he will pay me
                $1000, and if he makes more than him I have to pay him
                $10. Is this a good bet to make? What about if it were
                out of 100 shots instead of 5? Should I still take the
                bet? <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you know that the odds are
                slightly in your favor, all you have to do is wait and
                after enough trials you will eventually come out ahead.
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the events that we are
                talking about are independent events. Rolling a dice
                does not affect what comes up the next time you roll it.
                If I happen to flip a coin ten times and get heads 10
                times, what is the probability that I will get tails on
                the 11th toss? <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Bonus problem for this week:
                In a certain country a law was passed that a married
                couple can have as many girls as they want, but have to
                stop having children after they have one boy. After 10
                years will there be more boys than girls or more girls
                than boys? Explain.] <br>
                <br>
                What is the probability that you will roll at least one
                3 when rolling 4 dice? Solving this involves a common
                trick. The trick is to find what is the probability of
                not getting any 6's and then subtracting it from 1.
                Since you know that you are either going to roll one or
                more threes or you are not, the total must be one. The
                probability of </span></font><i><font face="Arial" size="-1"><span
                  style="font-size:12">not</span></font></i><font face="Arial"
              size="-1"><span style="font-size:12"> rolling a three is <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5/6 * 5/6 * 5/6 * 5/6 = 0.48 <br>
                That means you are a little more likely to roll at least
                one three than not roll any.&nbsp; This is actually how
                the whole branch of mathematics which is probability
                started. A French gambler in the 17th century was making
                a nice profit by betting people that at least one 6
                would show up if he rolled a dice 4 times. He then
                changed his bet to saying that a pair of sixes would
                show in 24 rolls, but because of a miscalculation of the
                probabilities started losing. He wrote a letter to
                Blaise Pascal, who wrote a letter to Pierre Fermat (a
                famous mathematician of the time), and these letters are
                considered the initial consideration of modern
                probability theory. <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; If you calculate the probabilities or just
                consider the historical results of certain investment
                activities you can determine an expected return on your
                investment over the long run. Here are some expected
                returns. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; Stock market : Some years it
                goes up some years down. Historically it gains about 10%
                a year over the long run. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; US treasuries : 2% a year, but
                does not fluctuate much. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; Roulette : -5% can happen in a
                single evening. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; Black Jack : -4% if you play
                very well.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; Slot machines : -10% or -30%
                percent based on the machines you use. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; State lottery : -40% (-60% if
                you account for the fact that you will have to pay a lot
                of tax). You are more likely to die in a car crash
                driving to the store to get your lottery ticket than you
                are to win. The people who play the lottery the most are
                poor people. If Bill Gates invested all his money ($100
                billion) in buying lottery tickets every month, in a
                year he would have 21 million, and after 2 years he
                would only have 47 thousand left. The government spends
                millions of dollars a year trying to convince you to buy
                lottery tickets. Even if you win, about half is kept in
                taxes. <br>
                <br>
                - Clearly casino gambling is a very poor use of your
                money if you are trying to hold onto it. So why do
                people do it? Because it is fun and in some cases
                addicting.<br>
                - why is flipping a coin random? because it is an
                example of a chaotic system. <br>
                - Make 2 sequences of numbers. One truly random, one
                which is not. Try to guess the difference. <br>
                - Play 3 card thriller. Three cards (r/r r/b b/b) bet
                whether or not the back of the card is red or black.
                (there is a 2/3 chance its the same as the front, but
                most will guess that it is a 50-50 chance). <br>
                - Play Monte hall puzzle with some sort of real prize.
                When one of the doors is opened, the remaining door goes
                from 1/3 to 2/3. <br>
                - Things in ordinary life where probability plays a huge
                role <br>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - surveys and polls <br>

                Statistics:&nbsp; Branch of math dealing with the
                analysis and interpretation of numerical data. Much of
                it is trying to see how much the data is different from
                random results. <br>
                &nbsp; - The death rate in the Navy during the
                Spanish-American War (1898) was 9 per 1000 For Civilians
                in New York City during the same period it was 16 per
                thousand. <br>
                Groups are not comparable. <br>
                &nbsp; The Navy is made up mostly of young men in known
                good health <br>
                &nbsp; The civilian population includes infants, old,
                and ill people. <br>
                <br>
                - In one study, 33% of women at Hopkins had married
                faculty members! There were three women enrolled at the
                time, and one of them had married a faculty man. <br>
                - Explain pi. Do you think that the sequence 0123456789
                appears in the number? yes. First around the 500,000
                decimal place. But it also appears many more times. An
                infinite number in fact. <br>
                - Chance of getting a heart or a face card (J,Q,K) (or
                one that is both) is&nbsp; 1/4 + 3/13 - 1/4 * 3/13 =
                11/26. <br>
                - Causality. Being healthy and doing yoga are highly
                correlated. Does yoga cause you to be healthy? Probably
                the set of people that do yoga is not a random sample of
                the population. It is a self-selecting group. The people
                who are interesting in trying to have healthy habits
                take up yoga. Heavy drinkers and smokers are less likely
                to take up yoga. <br>

                Testing for Disease : Suppose you've taken a test for a
                dreaded disease, which is 99% accurate. <br>
                If you have the disease, the test will be positive 99%
                of the time. <br>
                If you don't have the disease, the test will be negative
                99% of the time. <br>
                Suppose that the disease is rare and that only 0.1% of
                the population has it. <br>
                How concerned should you be if you test positive? <br>
                Don't be overly concerned. <br>
                You only have 9% chance of having D. <br>
                Population of 100,000 <br>
                0.1% = 100 people have D <br>
                99 of the 100 with D will test positive <br>
                However, 1% of 99,900 will also test positive, so 999
                healthy people <br>
                The probability of having D is therefore <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 99/(999+99) = 9% <br>
                For those who understand Bayes Rule : P(D|+) = <br>
                P(+|D)*P(D)/(P(+|D)*P(D)+P(+|not D)*P(not D)) = <br>
                &nbsp; 99%*0.1%/(99%*0.1% + 1%*99.9%) = 9%</span></font></td>
