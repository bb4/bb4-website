<big><big>Pioneer 5th Grade Math League Overview</big></big><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Goals</span>:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Learn advanced problem solving skills. We will not introduce any
math beyond the 5th grade level, but we will expose them to challenging
problems that use basic math in ways that students probably have not
seen before.</li>
  <li>Engender a passion for math
through enjoyable competitive game playing and fascinating problems.</li>
  <li>Foster collaboration skills. Learn effective strategies for
maximizing team effectiveness through competition.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Meetings</span>:&nbsp;
Fridays in room 35, 2:10-3:00pm. <br>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Overview<br>
<br>
</span>I believe that competition can be a great motivator for the kids
- especially the over achievers that are likely to be in this program.
Still we have to be careful that no one feels disheartened or left
because they are "losing". For this reason, I propose that we track
both individual and team scores as we progress through the year. At the
end of the year, we can do some sort of awards for the top team and top
individual performers. Having fun solving challenging problems should
be the primary motivation for active participation however.<br>
<br>
It would be nice to establish teams that are well balanced in terms of
ability. Ideally, each team should have a balannce of players with
different skills and abilities. In order to assess ability I would like
to give a half hour written assessment test (that I will create and
submit to you for review), and use the scores on this test together
with overall average scores from last years Continental Math League
(for those that have such a score). The size of the team will depend on
how many students participate. Probably 5 or 6 teams of 4 or 5 students
on each team would be best.<br>
<br>
Unlike last year, I think the teams should remain relatively fixed
throughout the year so that team members have a chance to develop some
camaraderie. Also players may be less likely to be absent if they think
they might be letting their team down. Similarly, students might be
motivated to be more involved if they feel part of a team rather than
being on their own. We should allow trading of members if all involved
parties agree to it.<br>
<br>
I would like to have a schedule where we alternate between playing the
team game and individual assessment/learning. It could work like this:<br>
<br>
week 1: Words of introduction. Explain what to expect and what is
expected of them. Give the half hour initial assessment test.<br>
<br>
week 2: Tell them what the teams are. Give them a chance to trade if
they really want. Let them come up with team names. Play a variation of
the <a href="http://barrybecker4.com/math/glassTokenGameRules.html">glass
token game</a>. Record team scores.<br>
<br>
week 3: Give a 20 minute assessment test. Go over two or three problems
from the test. Give a mini lesson on some topic. During the next game
session, questions will be related to that topic. Give bonus problem to
ponder until next week.<br>
<br>
week 4: Game session. Collect bonus problem solutions. Distribute
initial tokens (with additional tokens for correct solutions to bonus
problem). Play the game. Record team scores.<br>
<br>
week 2n - 1:&nbsp; 20 minute test. Discuss problems on test. Perhaps
have students describe their solutions on the board. Give mini lesson.
Give bonus problem.<br>
<br>
week 2n: Game session based on mini lesson from previous week.<br>
<br>
At the end of each test session give a challenge problem for them to
ponder until the following week. Only written solutions (in students
own handwriting) will be accepted. For correct solutions, add a one
token to initial number of tokens for that player's team during the
next game playing session. Bonus problem will be related to mini-lesson.<br>
<br>
Record both individual and team scores in an excel spreadsheet for data
analysis. We may show aggregated statistics of these scores with names
removed on the website.<br>
<br>
Team token penalties may be assessed for infractions like talking out
of turn, cheating, or other sorts of unsportsmanlike conduct. The token
penalties should be described up front so the students know what
behavior is expected. For example:<br>
<ul>
  <li>1 token for talking when quiet is expected.</li>
  <li>1 token for each minute late that a test is handed in after time
has been called.</li>
  <li>2 tokens for cheating, and test score is not counted.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<br>
There are a variety of <a
 href="http://barrybecker4.com/math/sampleProblems.html">topics to
select from for mini-lessons</a> for after the tests on
test taking weeks. These lessons will probably be only about 10-15
minutes in length but will describe what kinds of questions they can
expect in the next weeks game session.<br>
