	<td colspan=3 rowspan=1 width=609><span style="font-size:14">This test was all about percents. Yes the problems were hard, but we have been working with percents for a few weeks now. The maximum score was 80%, the minimum was 0.8%. The mean score was 24%, and the median score was 18%. This tells you that the distribution was skewed to the lower end. The highest 3 scores were 80%, 56% and 56%. Since the scores were not as high as I was hoping for it is likely that the students may see another similar test in their future.<br><br>Based on the answers, there are some key points that I think that some are still not understanding. I will try to emphasize these things in future weeks.<br>&nbsp; <br> - Percents are the same things as fractions.<br> - &quot;of&quot; means multiply in a word problem.<br> - Understand how to set up and solve like ratios.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, in problem 4, they could write<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20/80 = x/100<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x = 100 * 20 / 80 = 25&nbsp; <br><br>the following tell you the approximate portion of the class (as a percent) that got each problem correct.<br>1) 35%<br>2) 10%<br>3) 16%<br>4) 15%<br>5) 11%<br>6) 23%<br>7) 20%<br>8) 19%<br>9)&nbsp;&nbsp; 4%<br>10)&nbsp; 8%<br></span></td>
