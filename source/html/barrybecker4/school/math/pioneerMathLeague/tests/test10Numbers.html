	<td colspan=3 rowspan=1 width=638><span style="font-size:14"><br>1) Write an integer that is not also a whole number? ___</span><b><span style="font-size:14">-3</span></b><span style="font-size:14">______
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any negative whole number is acceptable. Only 2 or 3 students answered correctly.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The set of integers is {&nbsp; -Infinity, ...... -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, .......... Infinity }<br>
<br>2) What kind of number is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter? ___</span><b><span style="font-size:14">irrational</span></b><span style="font-size:14">__
<br>What is this ratio called? ___</span><b><span style="font-size:14">Pi</span></b><span style="font-size:14">___&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is its approximate value? __</span><b><span style="font-size:14">3.14159...</span></b><span style="font-size:14">._____&nbsp; 
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pi is a very important irrational number. Its decimal expansion is infinite. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would have accepted any number between 2.9 and 3.4 as an approximation.<br>
<br>3) What is the square root of 36? ___</span><b><span style="font-size:14">6</span></b><span style="font-size:14">_____
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Most got this.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6 times 6 = 36<br><br>4) What are the factors of 18? ____</span><b><span style="font-size:14">1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18</span></b><span style="font-size:14">_________
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Most got this. I would have accepted </span><b><span style="font-size:14">2, 3, 6, 9</span></b><span style="font-size:14">  (1 and 18 go without saying)<br>
<br>5) What are the prime factors of 420? ___</span><b><span style="font-size:14">2, 3, 5, 7</span></b><span style="font-size:14">________
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are the prime factors. You can determine them by creating a factor tree.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was very pleased to see that most knew how to create a prime factor tree.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>6) Write the prime factorization of 420 ___</span><b><span style="font-size:14">2*2*3*5*7</span></b><span style="font-size:14">________
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; The prime factorization is the unique product of primes for the specified whole number.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recall that the fundamental theorem of arithmetic says that every integer greater than 1<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; can be written as a unique product of primes.<br>&nbsp; <br>7) Write an example of a rational number that is not a whole number. ____</span><b><span style="font-size:14">2/3</span></b><span style="font-size:14">___________
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any fraction (a/b) that does not reduce to something in the set of whole numbers { 0, 1, 2, .......}<br><br>8) Write a fraction that is bigger than the square root of 2 and smaller than ? (Pi) ____</span><b><span style="font-size:14">2/1</span></b><span style="font-size:14">_______
<br>
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You needed to write a fraction that was greater than 1.414.. and less than 3.1415926<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such as&nbsp; 3/2, 4/4, etc.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>9) What is 2^6? __</span><b><span style="font-size:14">64</span></b><span style="font-size:14">_____
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2^2 = 4;&nbsp; 2^3 = 8;&nbsp; 2^4 = 16, 2^5 = 32;&nbsp; 2^6 = 2*2*2*2*2*2 = 64<br>
<br>10) What is 7^0?&nbsp; ___</span><b><span style="font-size:14">1</span></b><span style="font-size:14">____
<br> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x^0&nbsp; = 1 for all values of x where x is not equal to 0. <br>
<br>11) What is 9^-1?&nbsp; ___</span><b><span style="font-size:14">1/9</span></b><span style="font-size:14">____
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; When there is a negative in the exponent, you must take the reciprocal.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; So 9^-1 = 1/ 9^1.&nbsp;&nbsp; 9^-2 = 1/81. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; We discussed this a bit, but it looks like most did not remember.<br>
<br>12)&nbsp; Write the largest prime number less than 100 ____</span><b><span style="font-size:14">97</span></b><span style="font-size:14">_______
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 97 has only 1 and 97 as factors. 99 has 9 and 11 as factors.<br>
<br>13)&nbsp; Write your best estimate for the square root of 5 in decimal form ____</span><b><span style="font-size:14">2.236....</span></b><span style="font-size:14">________
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I gave only have credit for 2.5.&nbsp;&nbsp; A lot of people wrote 2.5, but that is half of 5, not the square root.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some people spent a whole lot of effort trying to iterate and find it to many decimal places.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was not necessary.<br>
<br>14)&nbsp; What is the volume of a rectangle that is 3 inches by 4 inches by 5 inches? __</span><b><span style="font-size:14">60 cubic inches</span></b><span style="font-size:14">____
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I gave half credit if you did not get the units right. Volume always has cubic units<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (or volume units like liters or quarts).<br><br>15) What are all values for x that work for the equation x^2 = 4?&nbsp; ___</span><b><span style="font-size:14">2, -2</span></b><span style="font-size:14">___<br><br>&nbsp; Almost everyone understood that 2 was a solution, but only one person found both 2 and -2.<br>&nbsp; It is important to reallize that -2 * -2&nbsp; = 4<br>
<br>16) What is 2/3 - 2/5?&nbsp;&nbsp; _____</span><b><span style="font-size:14">4/15</span></b><span style="font-size:14">________
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10/15 - 6/15 = 4/15<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; You must find the new denomicator by finding the LCM of 3 and 5.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; There are still a few that do not know how to add fraction with different denomators.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>17) Write a decimal that is greater than 4/7, but less than 5/8 ___</span><b><span style="font-size:14">0.572</span></b><span style="font-size:14">_________
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was a little tricky both 4/7 and 5/8 are a little bigger than 1/2 and they are very close together.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One way to approach the problem is to divie 4 into 7 using long division (0.571), then <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; use a number that is a little bigger.<br>
<br>18) What is the Greatest Common Factor of 24 and 18? ____</span><b><span style="font-size:14">6</span></b><span style="font-size:14">_______
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make a factor tree for both:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 24 : 2*2*2*3<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 18:&nbsp; 2*3*3<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Look at what is in common: 2*3 = 6<br><br>19) What is the Least Common Multiple of 9 and 15? ___</span><b><span style="font-size:14">45</span></b><span style="font-size:14">________
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make a factor tree for both:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9 :&nbsp; 3 * 3<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15 :&nbsp; 3 * 5<br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Multiply all the factors together except one of the 3's which are in common.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So&nbsp; 3 * 3 * 5 = 45.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another way to do it is to look at the multiples of 9 (18, 27, 36, 45) and 15 (30, 45) and stop when you find<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; the smallest one that is in common.<br><br>20) A dance choreographer requests enough dancers so that they can be evenly divided into groups of 4, 6, or 9 with none left over. What is the fewest number of dancers that must be hired?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ____</span><b><span style="font-size:14">36</span></b><span style="font-size:14">____<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is exactly the same as asking &quot;what is the LCM of 4, 6, 9?&quot;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Consider the multiples:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4 (8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, </span><b><span style="font-size:14">36</span></b><span style="font-size:14">)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6 (12, 18, 24, 30,&nbsp; </span><b><span style="font-size:14">36</span></b><span style="font-size:14">)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9&nbsp; (18,&nbsp; 27,&nbsp; </span><b><span style="font-size:14">36</span></b><span style="font-size:14">)</span></td>
