	<td colspan=3 rowspan=1 width=609><span style="font-size:14">I was planning on giving a different test this week. I will still use that test at some point in the future, but at the last minute I decided to give a test which would tell me if there were really making an attempt to understand what they missed on the last test. So what I did was give a test that was almost identical to the first test, but with all the numbers changed around. I really think the difficulty level was identical to the first test, but none of the answers were the same. For example, last time question three was &quot;what is 5% of 80?&quot;, this time I asked &quot;what is 20% of 120?&quot;.&nbsp; I figured that since <br>&nbsp; a) I had gone over the last test, <br>&nbsp; b) they had two weeks to try and understand what they did wrong, and&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; c) since I had explained all the answers on the website -<br> that maybe they would do much better this time. Well, some of them did, but a surprising number did the same or even worse than they did last time.<br><br>Excluding 2 newcomers, the average this time was 7.83. This is only 1.67 points higher than last time. I was really hoping for a greater improvement. I know the test was pretty hard, and I did not expect many high scores the first time.&nbsp; However, I did expect them make some attempt to understand how to do the problems they got wrong. So I was a bit disappointed.<br><br>A couple of students really stood out. Not only was one student tied for the top score last time (with 14), but he increased his lead tremendously this time. He got all but one correct (19 out of 20)! By contrast, Brian, who also got a 14 last time, got only a 13 this time.&nbsp; The biggest single improvement went from 7.5 last time to 13.5 this time. I can tell that some students really made an effort to review the test that was returned to them last time. Unfortunately, that was the exception and not the rule. I think most of the others threw it away after giving it a brief glance. I suppose the scores might have been different if I had warned them that this test would be just like the last, but since these were gate kids, I assumed they would be a bit more proactive.<br><br>This week I focused on percents because the initial test scores indicated that they were weak in that area. We did a variation of the game where team representatives went to the board to solve problems while the others shouted from the sidelines. I thought it worked pretty well. Next week the questions I ask while playing the token game will have percentages as a theme.<br><br>I was happy to see that 4 students submitted bonus problem solutions today. There were 2 solutions that were correct - even though I would have preferred that the solutions be a neater and more clearly explained. The teams that those students belong to will get a small bonus when we play the game next week.<br></span></td>
