	<td colspan=3 rowspan=1 width=609><span style="font-size:14">I looked at all the students work and gave half credit on problems where they were close. I always tell them there is no penalty for a wrong answer, but they still leave a lot blank. At least they all put their names on their paper (although I did remind them quite a bit and went around and verified). Probably the test was just a tad tougher for them than I thought it would be, but the results give me a lot of information and should allow me to create balanced teams.<br> <br>There was no problem that was so difficult that none got partial credit, and there was no problem that was so easy that everyone got it right. Surprisingly, the one problem that no one got completely correct (only 2 partially correct answers) was 18) &quot;What is the area of a right triangle with length 18in and height 6in?&quot;. To me, the fact that so many missed 18) was the biggest surprise. I thought it was considerably easier than some of the others. 29 fifth grade students took the test.<br> <br>The 2 problems that the students found easiest were 6) -6 /2&nbsp; and 8) the word problem.<br> <br>The highest possible score is 20. The highest actual score was 14 (there were 2 of them) and the lowest was 1. The average score was 6.14. My expectation (and hope) was that the average would be closer to 9 or 10, but I really didn't know what to expect. They had a time limit, and I could tell some students would have answered more given more time. I asked for them to turn in their scratch paper too, and they did, but there really wasn't much on it for the most part.<br> <br>One of the most interesting things was to see what the common wrong answers were. I will discuss these problems with them a bit next time.<br>Many thought that 6) -6 / 2 = -12 instead of -3<br>Many thought that&nbsp; 7) 5.2 - 8.71 = 3.51 instead of -3.51<br>Its interesting to note that even though the students are expected to know how to subtract numbers and get a negative, and not supposed to know how to multiply or divide negative numbers, many more got question 6) correct than question 7).<br> <br>I think many do not understand percentages. Most students thought 5% of 80 is 16 and not 4 (including my son). It seems that they did 80 / 5 for some reason instead of 5/100 * 80. We will need to take a closer look at this. Only one person got this problem correct (Rahul).<br> <br>I gave a lot of half credits on 9) factors of 36 and 10) which numbers are prime. Only a handful got each problem completely correct.<br> <br>It was good to see that many knew what 3 to the 5th&nbsp; power was. Brian told me they had just recently covered this - so maybe that explains it. The most common error was to multiply by 3 one too many times and get 729. The other way they did it wrong was to do 3 * 5 and get 15.<br> <br>For the estimation problem, I gave full credit for any guess between 300 and 600, and half credit if outside that range but between 200 and 900. The actual number is 430. There were very few wild guesses - which was good to see.<br> <br>Some other questions that I was suprised that they had difficulty with were<br>2) 2 / 3 of 1 / 4&nbsp; -&nbsp; only 3 got it.<br>4) only 3 got it, and many of the problems on last years test were like this.<br>11) computing an average of three numbers. Only 4 got it exactly. Surprisingly fewer got this one than 12) - which was the same thing, but with a negative number included. I did give a lot of partial credit for close answers though.<br>13) Only 2 got it exactly - though I did give a lot of partial credit for this too.<br>15) Either they got it or they didn't. No partial credit was given to anyone. 5 people got it. Same with 17 (which I thought was harder)<br> <br>Here are the tally's for each question:<br>1) 9 fully correct, 1 half credit<br>2) 3<br>3) 1, 1 half<br>4) 3, 1 half<br>5) 10, 1 half<br>6) 14<br>7) 3, 15 half&nbsp; ( I gave half credit if they got 3.51 instead of -3.51 - perhaps too lenient...)<br>8) 13<br>9) 4, 17 half&nbsp; ( I gave half if they listed at least 4 factors)<br>10) 7, 11 half ( I gave half if they at least showed that they had some inkling what a prime number was)<br>11) 4, 9 half&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ( Half if they were close)<br>12) 7, 2 half<br>13) 2, 13 half&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ( gave only half if they forgot units or between 3 and 4 gallons)<br>14)&nbsp; 9, 2 half<br>15) 4<br>16) 8, 2 half<br>17) 4, 1 half<br>18) 0, 2 half<br>19) 7, 6 half&nbsp;&nbsp; (gave only half credit for 0/3 since it was not in simplest form)<br>20) 6, 10 half&nbsp; (see above)</span></td>
