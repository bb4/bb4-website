	<td colspan=3 rowspan=1 width=638><span style="font-size:14"><br>1) Given this series of data values:&nbsp; -5,&nbsp;&nbsp; -2,&nbsp;&nbsp; -2,&nbsp;&nbsp; -1,&nbsp;&nbsp; 0,&nbsp;&nbsp; 4<br><br>What is the mean (or average)?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -6/6 = </span><b><span style="font-size:14">-1</span></b><span style="font-size:14"><br>What is the median?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (-2 -1)/2 = </span><b><span style="font-size:14">-1.5</span></b><span style="font-size:14"><br>What is the mode (if there is one)?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -2&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>What is the range?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4 - (-5) = </span><b><span style="font-size:14">9</span></b><span style="font-size:14"><br><br>2) About what percentage of the whole is the shaded slice in the following pie chart? _____</span><b><span style="font-size:14">17%</span></b><span style="font-size:14">_______ <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I gave full credit for anything between </span><b><span style="font-size:14">15% - 20%<br></span></b><span style="font-size:14"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I only game 1/2 credit if the student said 1/6, since I specifically asked for a percetnage.<br>&nbsp; <br><br>3) If I were to sketch a distribution of life expectancies in a certain country, I might draw something like the histogram below.&nbsp; Sketch next to it what you think the distribution of heights is for all 5th grade students at pioneer would be.<br> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A normal (bell-curved or Gaussian) distribution with height on the x axis. The min should be arount 3ft and the max around 6ft and the mean around 4.5 ft.<br><br><br>4) One of these plots was created by plotting 50 truly random points. Each point was determined by an (x, y) coordinate pair, where x and y were random in the same way that rolling a dice is random. Circle the plot that you think was created in this manner.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the first plot is the random data. Some may think it is not random because of the clumping of points. However this clumping is known as Poisson clupming and is a wll-known phenomenon. The second plot is too eventy ditributed. True random data is not so uniformly distributed. The final plot is too dense near the center.<br><br>5) Suppose you were one of 200 students who took a standardized test. You got only 40% of the problems correct, but you scored in the 90th percentile. How many students scored lower than you?&nbsp; _____</span><b><span style="font-size:14">180</span></b><span style="font-size:14">____. How many scored higher? ______</span><b><span style="font-size:14">19</span></b><span style="font-size:14">_______<br><br>&nbsp; Other answers were acceptable since it is conceivable that your score tied one of more other scores.<br><br>6) Create a sequence of 10 numbers for which the median value is much higher than the mean value. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many possible answers for this one. I gave 1/2 credit if your series had the median larger than the mean - even if it was only be a small amount. Here is one example of such a series:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><b><span style="font-size:14"> -1000, -1000, -1000, -1000,&nbsp; 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000</span></b><span style="font-size:14"><br>&nbsp; median = </span><b><span style="font-size:14">1,000</span></b><span style="font-size:14"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mean =&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><b><span style="font-size:14">200</span></b><span style="font-size:14"><br><br>7)&nbsp; Given the following histogram representing a distribution of test scores, estimate the mean and median scores.&nbsp;&nbsp; mean:______</span><b><span style="font-size:14">28</span></b><span style="font-size:14">______&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; median:____</span><b><span style="font-size:14">24</span></b><span style="font-size:14">______<br><br>Full credit for&nbsp; mean: 26-30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; median:&nbsp; 23-25<br>No one got full creidt for this one. A few got half credit.</span></td>
