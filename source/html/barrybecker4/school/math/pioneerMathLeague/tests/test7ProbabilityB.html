	<td colspan=4 rowspan=1 width=638><span style="font-size:14"><br>1) If a woman has 2 children, what is the probability that they are both girls? _____</span><b><span style="font-size:14">25%</span></b><span style="font-size:14">______&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you multiply probabilities for independent events.<br>
<br>2) If I roll 2 dice, what is the probability that no 6's will show? _____</span><b><span style="font-size:14">25/36</span></b><span style="font-size:14">______ 
<br>&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5/6 * 5/6&nbsp;&nbsp; Each dies has a 5/6 chance of not being a 6. Multiply independent events.<br>
<br>3) If I roll 2 dice, what is the probability that at least one 6 will show? ______</span><b><span style="font-size:14">11/36</span></b><span style="font-size:14">______
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some noticed that problems 2 and 3 represent all possibilities when throwing 2 dice, so<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 - 25/36 = 11/ 36<br>
<br>4) Two students miss their final exam because they were out late partying. The phony excuse they gave their professor was that they had a flat tire. The professor gave them a retest, and on that test, he asked them &quot;which tire?&quot;. What are the odds they get that question correct? (its correct if they have the same answer)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _____</span><b><span style="font-size:14">1/4</span></b><span style="font-size:14">_______
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; There are 4*4 = 16 total ways that they could answer, but there are only 4 ways that their answers could match.&nbsp; So, 4/16 = 1/4<br>
<br>5) Suppose I draw 2 cards from a normal deck of playing cards and they are both aces. If I draw another card at random (without replacing the first 2 cards), what are the chances that I draw another ace? ____</span><b><span style="font-size:14">1/25</span></b><span style="font-size:14">____________
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 aces left /&nbsp; (52 - 2 aces which have been drawn already) = 1/25<br>
<br>6) a. Suppose I have 4 letters and 4 labels. Each label corresponds to one of the letters. If I apply the labels randomly, what are the chances that I get all 4 labels on their correct letters? ______</span><b><span style="font-size:14">1/24</span></b><span style="font-size:14">_________
<br>
&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; There are 24 total different ways for 4 labels to be attached to 4 envelopes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; You can put the first label on one of 4 envelopes, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; the second on one of 3, and the 3rd on one of the 2 remaining envelopes. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; There is only one way to affix the last label to the last envelope. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we have 4*3*2*1 = 24 total variations, but only one way in which they are all correct.<br>&nbsp; <br>b.&nbsp;&nbsp; What are the chances that I get 3 of the 4 labels on their correct letters? _____</span><b><span style="font-size:14">0</span></b><span style="font-size:14">______
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I dare you to show me one way in which you can have exactly 3 labels correct.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You cannot do it.<br>c.&nbsp;&nbsp; What are the chances that I get 2 of the 4 labels on their correct letters? _____</span><b><span style="font-size:14">1/4</span></b><span style="font-size:14">_______
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are 6 ways to get 2 labels correct<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1, 2 | 1,3 | 1, 4 | 2, 3 | 2, 4 | 3, 4&nbsp;&nbsp; so 6/24 = 1/4<br>d. What are the chances that I get 1 of the 4 labels on their correct letters? ____</span><b><span style="font-size:14">1/3</span></b><span style="font-size:14">_____
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are 8 ways to get just 1 label correct, so 8/24 = 1/3<br>
<br>7) In my sock drawer I have 7 red socks, 9 blue socks, and 5 green socks. If I pull out socks one at a time, what is the most socks I could withdraw and still not have a pair?&nbsp; ____</span><b><span style="font-size:14">3</span></b><span style="font-size:14">____<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; The worst you can do is draw a red, blue, and green sock, but after that you must get a pair.<br>
<br>8)&nbsp; If I roll 2 dice, how many different ways can I roll a 7? ___</span><b><span style="font-size:14">6</span></b><span style="font-size:14">___
<br>
&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1, 6 | 2, 5 | 3, 4 | 4, 3 | 5, 2 | 6, 1<br>
<br>9)&nbsp; Suppose you are taking the STAR test and all 100 questions each have 5 possible answers. If you guess on all of them, what score do you expect to get?&nbsp; _______</span><b><span style="font-size:14">20%</span></b><span style="font-size:14">________ 
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; You expect to get&nbsp; 1/ 5 * 100 = 20 question correct or 20% of them.<br>
<br>10)&nbsp; If you draw a single card from an ordinary deck, what are the chances that it is a 3 or a Jack? _______</span><b><span style="font-size:14">2/13</span></b><span style="font-size:14">__________<br><br>&nbsp; Mutually exclusive events add. You cannot draw a card that is both a 3 and a Jack., so<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4 + 4)/ 52 = 8/52 or 2/13</span></td>
