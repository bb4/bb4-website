	<td colspan=3 rowspan=1 width=609><span style="font-size:14"> &nbsp; The kids did very well on the probability test today. The average score was 53%. Even more encouraging was the fact that the minimum score was 30%. The high score was 85%. This is much higher than on the first percent test, but then again maybe the questions were a little easier.<br><br> There were a couple of students that left the first question blank, but got many of the other harder problems correct. There were also a few that did not put 0 for number 9, even though I thought that was pretty much a free point. In all, though, they did quite well for the amount of discussion we have had so far.<br><br>&nbsp; Next week we will play the three card thriller and Monte Hall games to help them see that probabilites can be counterintuitive in some real word situations. <br><br> There will be another probability test is a couple of weeks that will be a little more challenging.</span></td>
