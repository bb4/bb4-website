	<td colspan=3 rowspan=1 width=609><span style="font-size:14"> &nbsp; In class today, we created a Venn diagram for the following problem. One volunteer from each team went to the board to construct it while I described the problem and gave them hints.<br><br> Testing for Disease : Suppose you've taken a test for a dreaded disease, which is 99% accurate.<br>If you have the disease, the test will be positive 99% of the time.<br>If you don't have the disease, the test will be negative 99% of the time.<br>Suppose that the disease is rare and that only 0.1% of the population has it.<br>How concerned should you be if you test positive?<br>&nbsp; Don't be overly concerned<br>&nbsp; You only have 9% chance of having it.<br><br>Using some specific numbers, suppose Population of 100,000<br>0.1% = 100 people have D<br>99 of the 100 with D will test positive<br>However, 1% of 99,900 will also test positive, so 999 healthy people<br>The probability of having D is therefore<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 99/(999+99) = 9%<br><br>Since the statistics test arrived late, I gave the kids a backup test that I had in reserve from earlier in the year. I'll give them that statistics test next week.<br><br>The average score on today's test was 56% - which is the highest on any test so far.<br>The minimum was 25% and the maximum was 90%. The median score (and mode score coincidentally) was 55%.<br><br>It always surprises me what the students find easy and what they find hard.<br>Almost everyone got number 8 correct - and I thought it was fairly hard.<br><br>8) Find A and B if<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 32<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AB<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; + 59&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; ---------<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 99&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A=_________&nbsp;&nbsp; B=___________<br><br><br>Only 1 person (Jason) got what I thought was a very easy problem:<br><br> 9)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw some ducks go by, but I did not count them. I did notice that there was 1 duck in front of 2 ducks, another duck behind 2 ducks, and there was a duck between 2 ducks. How many were there?&nbsp; _______________<br><br>I saw a wide variety of answers: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ducks, but only Jason said 3 ducks.<br><br>Only one person (Rahul) got problem 7<br> <br>&nbsp; 7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the area of an L shape that is 5 inches high, 3 inches wide and 1 inch thick?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; If you draw an L shape with these dimensions, the answer should be clear (7 sq inches).<br><br>The questions that most got correct were: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8<br>The quations that most got wrong were&nbsp; 3, 7, 9, 10</span></td>
