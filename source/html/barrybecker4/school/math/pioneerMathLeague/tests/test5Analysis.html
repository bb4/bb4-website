	<td colspan=3 rowspan=1 width=609><span style="font-size:14"> &nbsp; Yesterday we talked about probability a bit and I gave them their second test on percents. We have been discussing percents, fractions, ratios, and proportions for the last several weeks so I thought they would be well prepared. I also reminded them for several weeks that this test would be exactly like the last with the numbers changed around a little.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Though their scores did improve from an average of 24% to and average of 40%, I was hoping for greater improvment. I'm skeptical that any of them did any preparation for the test (including my son who actually did worse on this test than the last). The lowest score was 17.5% and the highest was 75% (there were 2 with 75%). Almost all students did show significant progress though - especially those that were lower scorers last time. The lowest scoring student last time, was able to improve from 2% last time to 32.5% this time. Only 2 out of 30 students did worse (only slightly) on this test than the last one. One girl made went from 9% last time to 50% this time.<br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have an idea for next week which will hopefully not let anyone slip through without better understanding. It will be a team competition to complete 3 worksheets. The 3 worksheets are all variations on a certain set of percent problems. Here's how it will work:<br>&nbsp; The 3 lowest scoring students on each team will work on the worksheets. The one or two top scores on the team will not write on the worksheets but will try to assist those working on them as best they can. At any time, a student can come up to the front to have some or all of the problems on a worksheet graded by one of the adults. If the answer is not exactly correct, they get an X, but they have another opportunity to go back and solve that problem. If on the third attempt, they still do not have the correct answer, they cannot try again. Before bringing the test up to be checked, they should get it reviewed by their top-scoring teammates. The process continues until all the worksheets are done or time runs out.<br>&nbsp; - Problems marked correct on the first check get full credit&nbsp;&nbsp; (c).<br>&nbsp; - Problems marked correct on the second check get 1/2 credit. (xc)<br>&nbsp; - Problems marked correct on the third check get 1/4 credit. (xxc)<br>&nbsp; - Blanks, or problems still not correct after 3 checks, get no credit. (xxx)<br>The team score will be the sum of the points on the 3 worksheets. It will be a team effort this time, and no individual scores will be given. I hope that the top scoring students will be able to share their insight with the others, and that by getting immediate feedback, and a second or third chance to find a solution, it will help them to gain some deeper understanding. Regardless of how this works out, I am planning to move on to some other topics shortly.</span></td>
