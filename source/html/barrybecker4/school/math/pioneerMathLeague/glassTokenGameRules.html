We should state up front that if a student speaks after we have asked for quiet, then their team will lose one token for each infraction.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>At the end of the session give a very hard &quot;bonus&quot; problem that will be worth an additional two or three tokens for their team if they can find a solution by the next meeting. To win the tokens, however, they must clearly explain how they solved the problem in their own words and in their own handwriting. So if they were to get help from other kids, adults, or books - that is ok - because at least they thought about it and took time to write out a solution. The problem should be hard enough that only a few will do it and have acceptable solutions. In addition we could give tokens for solving in a similar manner any problem that they got wrong on a previous math league test.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>I thought about giving a prize to the winning team, but I'm not sure it is a good idea. Introducing an extrinsic motivator might hinder development of a natural desire to solve the problems for their own sake.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Some challenge problems given so far: <br>&nbsp; - If a brick weighs 9 pounds + 1/2 a brick. How much does a brick and a half weigh? <br>&nbsp; - Can you tell me 2 numbers, neither of which ends in 0, that when multiplied together equal 1000? <br>&nbsp; - You have some Amoebas in a dish. Every minute their number doubles. After one year, the amoebas cover the earth. When did they cover half the earth?<br></span></font></td>
