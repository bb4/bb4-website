    <br>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Goals</span>:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Prepare students for the Math League contests scheduled for
        later in the year (February and April). The top 5 student scores
        will be averaged to determin AMS' ranking relative to other
        schools. <br>
      </li>
      <li>Learn advanced problem solving skills. We will try not to
        introduce math concepts beyond the 8th grade level, but we will
        expose them to challenging problems that use basic math in ways
        that students probably have not seen before.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Engender a passion for math through enjoyable, competitive
        game playing and fascinating, meaningful, problems.</li>
      <li>Foster collaboration skills. Learn effective strategies for
        maximizing team effectiveness through competition.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Meetings</span>:&nbsp;

    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Overview<br>
      <br>
    </span>I believe that competition can be a great motivator for the
    kids - especially the over achievers that are likely to be in this
    program. Still we have to be careful that no one feels disheartened
    or left because they are "losing". For this reason, I propose that
    we record both individual and team scores as we progress through the
    year. At the end of the year, we can do some sort of awards for the
    top team and top individual performers. Having fun solving
    challenging problems should be the primary motivation for active
    participation, however. Nobody will fail math league, and it is
    completely independent from their regular school evaluation.<br>
    <br>
    Teams will be created that are well balanced in terms of ability.
    Ideally, each team will have a balannce of players with different
    skills. An initial written assessment test (that I create), will be
    used to help determine the teams. The size of the team will depend
    on how many students participate. Probably 6 teams of 4 or 5
    students on each team would be best. Teams will remain relatively
    fixed throughout the year so that team members have a chance to
    develop some camaraderie. Also players may be less likely to be
    absent if they think they might be letting their team down.
    Similarly, students might be motivated to be more involved if they
    feel part of a team rather than being on their own.<br>
    <br>
    I would like to have a schedule where we alternate between playing
    the team game and individual assessment/learning. It could work like
    this:<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">week 1</span>: Words of
    introduction. Explain what to expect and what is expected of them.
    Give the half hour initial assessment test.<br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">week 2</span>:<span
      style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>Tell them what the teams are.
    Let them come up with team names. Play a variation of the <a
      href="glassTokenGameRules.html">team competition game</a>. Record
    team scores.<br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">week 3</span>: Give a 30 minute
    assessment test. Go over two or three problems from the test. Give a
    mini lesson on some topic. During the next game session, questions
    will be related to that topic. Give bonus problem to ponder until
    next week.<br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">week 4</span>: Game session.
    Collect bonus problem solutions. Distribute initial tokens (with
    additional tokens for correct solutions to bonus problem). Play the
    game. Record team scores.<br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">week 2n - 1</span>:&nbsp; 30 minute
    test. Discuss problems on test. Perhaps have students describe their
    solutions on the board. Give mini lesson. Give bonus problem.<br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">week 2n</span>: Game session based
    on mini lesson from previous week.<br>
    <br>
    At the end of each test session give a challenge problem for them to
    ponder until the following week. Only written solutions (in students
    own handwriting) will be accepted. For correct solutions, add a one
    token to initial number of tokens for that player's team during the
    next game playing session. Bonus problem will be related to
    mini-lesson.<br>
    <br>
    Record both individual and team scores in an excel spreadsheet for
    data analysis. We may show aggregated statistics of these scores
    with names removed on the website.<br>
    <br>
    Team token penalties may be assessed for infractions like talking
    out of turn, cheating, or other sorts of unsportsmanlike conduct.
    The token penalties should be described up front so the students
    know what behavior is expected. <br>
