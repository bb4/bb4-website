	<td colspan=3 rowspan=1 width=609><span style="font-size:14"> &nbsp; The kids did reasonable well on the probability test today. The average score was 41%. It was longer and harder than the last test.<br><br>This week the children played the Monty Hall game, had a second probability test, and played poker.<br>The kids were excited to Play poker, so may have not spent as much time on the test as they otherwise would. It was hard to get them to leave at the end because they were having such a good time with it.<br>Not sure they paid much attention to the printout showing the probabilities of different the poker hands.<br><br>For the Monty Hall game, kids chose to keep their original guess 3/4 of the time. I kept track on the board for 10 trials. I hope that given the empirical evidence and my explanation that the best choice is to switch when offered.<br><br>Some interesting results on the test today.<br>The high score was 16. and the low score was 4.5.<br><br>Only Tim got questions 2 and 3 completely correct. No one else got either 2 or 3 completely correct.<br>I gave 1/2 credit for 3 if they realized that P(q3)&nbsp; = 1 - P(q2). About 20% realized this.<br>Problem 6 had 4 parts and as a result was worth 4 times what the other questions were.<br>We finally had a question that no one got (6a). This is the first time this happened on any of the tests so far. Very few realized that it is impossible to have exactly 3 labels affixed correctly to the 4 envelopes<br>(only 2 people got it, and one of those people put 0 for all 4 answers, so I have to wonder).<br><br>The set of questions that most kids understood (about 50% correct in each case) were 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10.<br>The ones that virtually no one got were 2, 3, 6abcd (I will spend some time going over these next week)<br><br>I was surprised at some of the answers for question 1 (Prob(2 girls if have 2 kids)). Many said 1/2. Slightly better was 1/3, but one said 2/3.<br>On question 9, some people believe that if they guessed randomly on the STAR test, then their expected scores would be 5%, 50%, or in one case 97% (they must think they are good at guessing).<br></span></td>
