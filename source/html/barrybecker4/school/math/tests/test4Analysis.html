These are the instructions that were given:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i><span style="font-size:14">These are variations of the bonus problems so far. Write a solution for each such that someone else can read and understand how to solve the problem. You may work collaboratively in your assigned teams, but all team members still need to submit their own test. Correct answers without an explanation will not get full credit.<br></span></i><span style="font-size:14"><br>I was pretty generous on giving partial credit, but I did not give full credit if there was not an explanation along with a correct answer. Variance was lower this time owing to the fact that there was collaboration within groups. Even so, there were 2 1's, the lowest score. The highest score was 11 (out of 20), and there were 3 who got that. The average score was 7.04.<br><br></span><b><span style="font-size:14">Team scores:</span></b><font face="Courier"><span style="font-size:14"><br>Mathematicians&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  6.60<br>Whiz Kids&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.75<br>Cool Kids&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10.00<br>Mathletes&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.00<br>Human Calculators&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 5.25<br>KFC&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.00</span></font><span style="font-size:14"><br><br>Cool Kids (Chris, Jason, Avani, Elaina) were the top scoring team.

Next week I will try to review a few things that I think they might be missing and try to make future tests a little easier.</span></td>
