Only 2 or 3 students answered correctly.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The set of integers is {&nbsp; -Infinity, ...... -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, .......... Infinity }<br><br>2) What kind of number is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter? ___</span><b><span style="font-size:14">irrational</span></b><span style="font-size:14">__<br>What is this ratio called? ___</span><b><span style="font-size:14">Pi</span></b><span style="font-size:14">___&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is its approximate value? __</span><b><span style="font-size:14">3.14159...</span></b><span style="font-size:14">._____&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pi is a very important irrational number. Its decimal expansion is infinite. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would have accepted any number between 2.9 and 3.4 as an approximation.<br><br>3) What is the square root of 36? ___</span><b><span style="font-size:14">6</span></b><span style="font-size:14">_____<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Most got this.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6 times 6 = 36<br><br>4) What are the factors of 18? ____</span><b><span style="font-size:14">1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18</span></b><span style="font-size:14">_________<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Most got this.
