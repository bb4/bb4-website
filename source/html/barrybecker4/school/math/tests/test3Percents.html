	<td colspan=4 rowspan=1 width=638><span style="font-size:14">1)&nbsp; What is 30% of 200? ______</span><b><span style="font-size:14">60</span></b><span style="font-size:14">______&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<br>
&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If 30% of 100 is 30, then 30% of 200 is 60.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About 1/3 of the students got this problem correct (more than any other question).<br>
<br>2)&nbsp; There were 40 questions on the test. Joe got 3 wrong. What percent did he get correct? ___</span><b><span style="font-size:14">92.5%</span></b><span style="font-size:14">____ 
<br>&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are 40 questions so each one is worth 100/40 = 2.5%<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another way to look at it is to find (40-3)/40 = 37/40= x/100,&nbsp; x= 100* 37/40 = 370/4 = 92.5%<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I gave half credit if you guessed and were between 88% and 95%<br>
<br>3)&nbsp; What is 20% of 20% of 125? _____</span><b><span style="font-size:14">5</span></b><span style="font-size:14">_____ 
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20% is the same as 1/5<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1/5 of 1/5 of 125 =&nbsp; 125/ 5 / 5 = 25/ 5 = 5<br>
<br>4)&nbsp; What percent of 80 is 20?&nbsp;&nbsp; ____</span><b><span style="font-size:14">25%</span></b><span style="font-size:14">_____
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the same as asking what is 20/80 in percentage terms?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should know that 1/4 is the same as 25% <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Common wrong answers were 40% and 4. <br>
<br>5)&nbsp; 49&nbsp; is 70% of what number?
&nbsp; ____</span><b><span style="font-size:14">7</span></b><span style="font-size:14">0_____<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 70/100 x = 49? <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 100 * 49 / 70 = 10 * 49/7 = 10 * 7 = 70<br>
<br>6)&nbsp; You are a helper an expedition that finds $20 million in pirate treasure. The leader has stated that he gets 60% and the rest will be split among the 10 helpers (of which you are one). What is your cut of the loot?&nbsp; </span><b><span style="font-size:14">$800,000</span></b><span style="font-size:14">
<br> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the leader take 60% for himself, that leaves only $8 million to split among 10 helpers.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That means you get $800,000. One person wrote 4% an I accepted that too.<br><br>7)&nbsp; If Sabrina earns $150 a day, and her boss just increased her salary to $165 a day, by what percentage was her salary increased?&nbsp;&nbsp; ______</span><b><span style="font-size:14">10%</span></b><span style="font-size:14">______
<br>
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I did not give any partial credit on this one because I though it was relatively easy.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10% of 150 is 15. So 150 + 15 = 156. The salary increase was 10% <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More people had 15% as an answer than had 10%.<br><br>8)&nbsp; Duncan sold 50% of his DVDs plus 1/2 a DVD to Veronica. He then sold 50% of what was left plus half a DVD to Pat. He has three DVDs left. How many DVDs did he have originally? ___</span><b><span style="font-size:14">15 DVDs</span></b><span style="font-size:14">__
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is very much like the yugi-oh problem we had during team competition earlier.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the people who had 13 as their answer probobly did not verify it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Try working backwards. Starting with 3, figure out how many he had before the last transaction.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only number that works is 7 because 50% of 7 is 3.5. 3.5 + 1.2 = 4.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then for the transaction before that he must have had 15 because 50% of 15 is 7.5 + 1/2 = 8.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally verify your answer:&nbsp; 15 - (7.5 + 1/2) = 7 - (3.5 + 1/2) = 3<br>
<br>9)&nbsp; If you flipped a set of 3 pennies 1000 times, estimate how many of those thousand times do you think all three pennies would come up heads? ____</span><b><span style="font-size:14">125</span></b><span style="font-size:14">______
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm glad to see that a lot of people realized that they should expect fewer than half the trials to <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; come up all heads. For and away the most popular answer was 333, but I only gave 1/5 credit for that.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Think of the 8 different ways that 3 pennies can land. All heads is just one of those 8 ways.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of probability the chance of getting all heads is 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/8<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1/8 * 1000 = 125.&nbsp;&nbsp; Only one person got this exactly right<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you don't believe the answer is 125 try running this </span><a href="http://barrybecker4.com/games/dice_en.html"><span style="font-size:14">dice simulation I wrote in java</span></a><span style="font-size:14">.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select 3 dice with 2 sides each (to simulate 3 pennies) from the options. <br><br><br>10) If you put $100 in the bank, and it earns 20% interest each year, estimate how much will you have after 10 years? (Keep in mind that the interest is compounded each year) _____</span><b><span style="font-size:14">$619</span></b><span style="font-size:14">_____<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wrote on the board that compounded means that interest is computed based on the original<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; amount plus all the interest earned so far.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This means that after the first year you will have $120 and <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; after the second year you will have $131 and <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; after the third year you will have $143.1 and <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; after the tenth year you will have $619.17 (full credit for $600-$650) <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another way to do it is 100 (1.2)^10 = 619.17</span></td>
