<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5^3 * 5^3 = 125 * 125 = 15,625<br>
<br>2) (WK)&nbsp; X + Y = X - Y = X times Y.&nbsp; What are X and Y?&nbsp; _____</span><b><span style="font-size:14">X=0, Y=0</span></b><span style="font-size:14">_____________

<br>3) (CK)&nbsp; There are 3 kids at a party. X number of additional kids arrive. Three leave. Another 12 kids come. X=31. Add it all together. If you multiply the sum by 86, then add 502, then divide by 60, then multiply by 2, you will get the number of kids at the party. 
<br>How many kids were at the party? _____</span><b><span style="font-size:14">140 kids</span></b><span style="font-size:14">________
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 *&nbsp; ( 43 * 86 + 502)/60&nbsp; = 140<br>

<br> You should notice that each term can be described by the previous term squared + 2.<br><br>5) (Ml) There are six girl scouts. Each has six backpacks.

&nbsp;&nbsp; 6*2&nbsp;&nbsp; +&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6*6 * (2*4&nbsp;&nbsp; +&nbsp;&nbsp; 4*4&nbsp;&nbsp; +&nbsp;&nbsp; 8*4) = 2,028&nbsp; (includes legs of girl scouts)<br>&nbsp; (scouts)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; large&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; med.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; kittens<br><br>6) (Ml)&nbsp; A census man goes to Jonathan's house. He asks how old his children are. Jonathan replies that if you multiple the ages of his three children you get 36. He also says that if I tell you the sum, you still won�t get it. My oldest child likes dogs. How old are Jonathan's three children? __</span><b><span style="font-size:14">2,2,9</span></b><span style="font-size:14">_____
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First write all the different sets of three numbers whos product is 36&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1,6,6; 3,3,4; 9,2,2;&nbsp; 2,9,1)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason it cannot be 3,3,4 is because you know it has to be either 1,6,6 or 9,2,2 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; given the clue that knowing the sum will not be enough information for you to deduce<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the answer since these both sum to 13.<br>
<br>7) (Ml) Three lemons make two glasses of lemonade. How many lemons do you need to make seven glasses of lemonade?&nbsp; ______</span><b><span style="font-size:14">10.5 lemons</span></b><span style="font-size:14">__________
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 * 7/2 = 21/2 = 10.5 lemons.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>8) (Mm)&nbsp; There are 7 buses on their way to a pet show. Each bus has 7 boys, and every boy has 7 big dogs, and for every big dog there are 7 small dogs. How many legs are there? ___</span><b><span style="font-size:14">11,074 legs</span></b><span style="font-size:14">__________
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 7*7*2 +&nbsp; 7*7*( 7*4&nbsp; + 7*7*4) = 11,074<br>

Ninety nine kids have a better score than you. The rest do not. What percentile are you? _____</span><b><span style="font-size:14">90 percentile</span></b><span style="font-size:14">_________________
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Percentile means the percentage of people that scored less.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since 900 were less than or equal, your percentile is about 90. I would have accepted 89.9 as well.<br>
<br>10)&nbsp; (KFC)&nbsp; If x $ z � h | f&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x - 6&nbsp; - z - h/f,&nbsp; then what is 7$4 - 5|9 ? ______</span><b><span style="font-size:14">-3 5/9</span></b><span style="font-size:14">__________

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; substituting, we get&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7 - 6 - 4 - 5 / 9 =&nbsp;&nbsp; - 3&nbsp; 5/9<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3/4 + 2/5 = 15/20 + 8/20 = 23/20&nbsp; =&nbsp; 1&nbsp; 3/20<br>
<br>12)&nbsp; (HC) A roller coaster carried 25 people. It stopped to let another 30 people on. Since everyone threw up, nobody came on for that round. The roller coaster kept going with no one in it. It stopped and let 1,235,456 people in. Only 34,599 came out. The coaster stopped again and most people got off. The roller coaster now has 5 people in it. It stopped again and 325, 563 people came in. It stopped again and 325, 563 people came in. The roller coaster stopped again and 1,079 people came out. How many times did the roller coaster stop altogether?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I counted that it stops </span><b><span style="font-size:14">6 times</span></b><span style="font-size:14">. </span></td>
