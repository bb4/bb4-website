    <h1>Adventure</h1>
    <p>
    <a href="https://github.com/bb4/bb4-adventure">This project</a> started as
    framework for building simple text based adventures.
    The scenes were stored in an xml file.
    I thought it would be cool to have images and sounds associated with the scenes, so I added a UI.
    When editing the xml file got tedious, I decided to add the graphical editor.
    You can edit the story if you know the password.
    Next I would like to add support for keeping track of found items and hit points.
    This story is based on a adventure in Dragon Magazine back in 1980.
    This framework can also be used for educational purposes.
