<h1>Barry's Programming Projects</h1>
<p>
    The source for all of these programs is <a href="https://github.com/bb4">available on GitHub</a>.
</p>
<p>
    You can group most of my programs into 3 main categories corresponding to three separate open source projects
    <ul>
        <li><a href="bb4-simulations/simulations_index.html">Simulations</a></li>
        <li><a href="bb4-puzzles/puzzles_index.html">Puzzles</a></li>
        <li><a href="bb4-games/games_index.html">Games</a></li>
    </ul>
    and some other miscellaneous projects that do not fit nicely into one of those categories.
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/barrybecker4/TutorMatch">TutorMatch</a>
            - a Google Apps Script web application for matching students for peer tutoring</li>
        <li><a href="http://barrybecker4.com/interests/aikido/aikido_grammar.html">Aikido grammar and DHTML technique builder</a>
        <li><a href="http://barrybecker4.com/bayes-rule-viz/index.html">Disease testing explained with Bayes' rule</a></li>
        <li><a href="bb4-adventure/adventure_index.html">Adventure</a></li>
        <li><a href="flex/flexApps.html">Flash/Actionscript projects</a>
            - Now that flash has been killed in the browser,
            you need to install <a href="https://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/about/">Flash Player</a> locally if you want to run</li>
        <li><a href="http://barrybecker4.com/wordle/index.html">Wordle</a> my version of the popular word game from NYT. Try it without using the hints.</li>
    </ul>
<p>

Many of the games and simulations have an optimization mode where they can iteratively improve using various strategies.
I find it fascinating to discover how the computer can be used to solve problems.
In my spare time, I create implementations for some small fraction of the things I would like to do.
All the <a href="https://github.com/bb4">code</a> is built and deployed using
<a href="http://www.gradle.org/">Gradle</a>.
I used to deploy the projects as applets and web-start apps,
but that is no longer supperted in browsers, so now I use a simpler <a href="bb4-common/run-instructions.html">process</a>.
