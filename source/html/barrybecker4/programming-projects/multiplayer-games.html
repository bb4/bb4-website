      <h1>Multiplayer Online Games</h1>
      <p>
          Lately, I have been working on some multiplayer games with the hope of perhaps monetizing them. They are developed with Svelte and use Cloudflare for deployment.
          <ul>
              <li><a href="https://world-conflict.pages.dev/">Galactic Conflict</a> - a real-time strategy space war game
              <li><a href="https://galactic-conflict.pages.dev/">World Conflict</a> - a turn-based, risk-like game  (not yet released)
              <li><a href="https://galactopoly.pages.dev/">Galactopoly</a> - a galaxy themed version of that old family favorite (not yest released)
              <li><a href="https://into-the-singularity.pages.dev/">Into the Singularity</a> - a grand strategy simulation game about the future. Meant for educational and entertainment purposes. This one is a work in progress. Don't expect it to do much yet.
          </ul>
