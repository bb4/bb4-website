        <div class="puzzle-question">
            <p>Suppose a country like China decides it wants more girls. They create a law that says you can have as many children as you want, but you must stop having them as soon as you have a boy. After 10 years, what is the ratio of boys to girls?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="solution-text">
            <p>1:1</p>
        </div>
        <div class="solution-text">
            <p><b>explanation 1</b>: Altogether you will have a set of pregnancies. Each pregnancy is an independent event that has a 50% chance of producing a boy and 50% chance of a girl. Regardless of what policy you choose the result will always be half boys and half girls. An independent event is one that is not influenced by other events - like flipping a coin for example.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="solution-text">
            <p><b>explanation 2</b>: Start with the first child born to every family. Half will be boys and half will be girls. In aggregate, about half will be boys and half girls. Now, the families with girls will have a second child. Half of the second children born will be boys and half will be girls. Again, the second child ratio will be 1:1. If the second child is a girl, there may be third child. Again, half of them will be boys/girls. We can continue to infinity but each successive child will be half boys and half girls.

        <div class="puzzle-title">Investing</div>
        <div class="puzzle-question">
            <p>Suppose you invest $100,000 in a volatile stock. Each year, with equal probability, it either rises 60% or falls by 40%. You declare that your heirs are not to sell the stock for 100 years. What would be the expected value of the stock after 100 years (the mean)? What would be the expected median value? What would be the expected mode?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="solution-text">
            <p>The expected value would be $1,378,000,000. If there are many stocks like this, the total market value will rise dramatically (value = expected * num_stocks)</p>
            <p>100,000 * ((1.6 + 0.6) / 2)^100 = 100,000 * 1.1^100</p>
            <p>The mode and the median are both $13,000. = 100,000 * (1.6)^50 * (0.6)^50.</p>
            <p>While on average you expect 10% return a year, the most likely scenario (mode) is that you'll end up with $13,000. Moreover, more than half the people will end up with $13,000 or less.</p>

        <div class="puzzle-question">
            <p>(I heard this one on car talk) A man bought a 5-foot-long fishing rod, then got on a bus home. The driver told him no one was allowed to bring anything longer than 4 feet on the bus. So the man went back to the store, then caught another bus, still carrying the same rod. This time, the driver said nothing. Why?</p>

        <div class="solution-text">
            <p>The man got a 3' by 4' box at the store, in which he placed the rod diagonally. The second bus driver saw this as a 4-foot object.</p>

        <div class="solution-text">
            <p>Impossible!</p>
            <p>X = length of half the track</p>
            <p>Time to finish all = 2X/V = 2X/300 = X/150</p>
            <p>Time spent = X / V = X / 150.</p>
            <p>He has zero time to finish the second half.</p>
            <p>If he drives 450, he'll average (2X/(X/150)+(X/450)) = 225 MPH</p>

        <div class="puzzle-question">
            <p>(I know you've heard this one before, but try to remember how to calculate it - 2 ways) The probability that a random person has a birthday on 10/16 is 1/365 = 0.27%. How many people do you need to have in a room so that the probability is over 50% that two share a birthday?</p>

            <p>23 people are needed.</p>
            <p>With 42 people, you have 90% probability.</p>
            <p>23 people -> 253 pairs (23*22/2). 99.726% ^ 253 = 50% or 364/365 * 363/365 * 362/365.</p>

    <div class="solution">
        <div class="puzzle-title">Monte Hall</div>
        <div class="puzzle-question">
            <p>Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given a choice of three doors: Behind one door is a new car. Behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say number 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say number 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door number 2?"</p>
            <p>Is it to your advantage to switch your choice? Why?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="solution-text">
            <p>Due to symmetry, assume you pick door #1.</p>
            <p>Consider the three equally probable scenarios. In 2 of them, you win if you change. Therefore the probability is .66 that you win if you change. It is much better than the .33 you have if you don't change. The host gives you information when he opens a door known not to have the prize.</p>
            <p>If you are still not convinced, consider it this way:</p>
            <p>Suppose that there are 1000 doors. You select one of them. Now the host opens 998 of the other doors, revealing 998 goats. Do you still want to keep your door? Your door has only a .001 chance of being correct while the alternative has a probability of .999</p>
            <p>Of course, it's possible that the host is trying to trick you. Perhaps they only open the other doors if the one you picked was the correct one. Then, if you know this puzzle, you would switch, and as a result lose.</p>

        <div class="puzzle-title">Proof of why 1=2</div>
        <div class="puzzle-question">
            <p>X = Y           Start with this assumption<br>
                X² = XY         Multiply each side by x<br>
                X² - Y² = XY - Y²     Subtract Y² from each side<br>
                (X-Y)(X+Y) = Y(X-Y)   Factor<br>
                (X-Y)(X+Y) = Y(X-Y)   Cancel out (X-Y)<br>
                (X+Y) = Y                   After cancelling<br>
                Y+Y = Y                     Replace X with Y (step 1)<br>
                2Y = Y                       Add the two Y's<br>
                2 = 1                         Cancel the Y's<br>
                QED</p>

        </div>
        <div class="solution-text">
            <p>On the fifth step you are dividing by 0 if your assumption that x=y is true. This is illegal in math.</p>

        <div class="puzzle-title">2 Envelopes Paradox</div>
        <div class="puzzle-question">
            <p>You are shown two envelopes. You are told that one has X dollars and the other 2X dollars. You select one of them. The one who offered then gives you the option to exchange it for the other.</p>
            <p>Here is why you should switch:<br>
                The one you have has Y dollars in it<br>
                There is 50% that the other has 2Y and 50% that it has 0.5Y<br>
                On average, it therefore has 0.5*2Y + 0.5*0.5Y = 1.25Y, so it has more money! Right? Why not?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="solution-text">
            <p>The assumption violates an esoteric rule of statistics that the sample set needs to be bounded. There are many scholarly papers written on this. It's something to do with the probabilities of infinite sets.</p>

                Business School: 90% for females vs. 80% for males<br>
                Law school: 33% for females vs. 10% for males</p>

            <p>The business school accepts almost everyone (82.5%)</p>

            <p>Women apply more to the law school.</p>
