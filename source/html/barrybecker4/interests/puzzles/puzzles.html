<div class="intro">
    <p>In March 2002, Ronny Kohavi gave a talk on "intuition busters" at Blue Martini Software. By chance, I later learned that many of the puzzles came from "Ruminations of a Numbers Man" by John Paulos.</p>
    <p>In this first pass, I will not supply the <a href="puzzle_answers.html">answers</a>. None of these problems require knowledge of math beyond high school (except one which is currently an unsolved mystery).</p>

        <div class="puzzle-content">
            <p>A single tower of nickels stretching from sea level to the height of Mount Everest would contain more than 4 million coins. How large a box would you need to put these in?</p>
            <p>If you place all living humans end to end, they would extend to the moon and back more than eight times. If you tried to fit every human being into the Grand Canyon, giving each a cube, which is n x n x n, what is n?</p>

        <div class="puzzle-content">
            <p>Suppose a country like China decides it wants more girls. They create a law that says you can have as many children as you want, but you must stop having them as soon as you have a boy. After 10 years, what is the ratio of boys to girls?</p>

            <p>Suppose you invest $100,000 in a volatile stock. Each year, with equal probability, it either rises 60% or falls by 40%. You declare that your heirs are not to sell the stock for 100 years. What would be the expected value of the stock after 100 years (the mean)? What would be the expected median value? What would be the expected mode?</p>
            <p>Assume 100 people invested $100,000 in 100 different volatile stocks. The mean would be the average value of these 100 stocks after 100 years, the median would be the value in the middle if you sorted the values, and the mode would be the most common value of the 100.</p>

            <p>You are shown two envelopes. You are told that one has X dollars and the other 2X dollars. You select one of them. The one who offered then gives you the option to exchange it for the other.</p>

                There is 50% that the other has 2Y and 50% that it has 0.5Y<br>
                On average, it therefore has 0.5 * 2Y + 0.5 * 0.5Y = 1.25Y, so it has more money! Right? Why not? (this one is hard)</p>

Even though one drives a Yugo, they have equal power. Now think of four holding: 27%, 26%, 25%, 22%. The last stockholder's vote is never crucial (dummy). Similarly, 45%, 44%, 7%, 4%. The first three have equal power, the 4th is a dummy. Banzhaf power index: # of ways to change a coalition.

            <p>The normal body temperature is believed to be 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit by most people in the US. However, it is 98.2 degrees. Why is this number wrong? Dr. Wunderlich measurements were in Celsius, and he rounded 36.8 to 37. People in the US liked to be more accurate, so they converted 37 Celsius to Fahrenheit, keeping an extra digit.</p>

                What was the most important factor helping the salary increase?<br>
                In 1940, they had many more half-time employees. If you work full-time, your salary doubles.</p>

            <p>- The death rate in the Navy during the Spanish-American War (1898) was 9 per 1000.<br>
