              &nbsp; When I was a kid, I practiced karate at the adult school on
              the weekends. I started when I was in the third grade. My teacher
              then was a powerfully built Italian woman. I really liked the
              classes and the teacher. I remember one time on a test, the
              teacher asked me where the "solar plexis" was, and I pointed to it
              on her, rather than on myself. All the parents laughed. Very
              embarrassing. When she left as the teacher for that program, I
              quit for a couple of years, but eventually decided to go back when
              I was in 8th grade. I remember sitting on the school bus going
              home one day and just making the decision that karate was
              something I really wanted to do again. <br>
              &nbsp; So I enrolled at the adult school again, now with a new
              teacher, Sensei Karvel Thornber. I grew to really like working
              with this teacher. The name of the style (believe it or not) was
              Modified Ninja-Isshinryu Karate. I learned lots of kata and
              weapons work. We played with just about every traditional weapon
              you can imagine: swords, knives, escrima, sai, tonfa, bo, bokken,
              nunchaku, and three sectional staff. I banged my head a lot with
              the three sectional staff, but I eventually got pretty good with
              it. What I didn't learn was any real fighting skill. I practiced
              all through high school and eventually earned the rank of san-dan.
              It was during this time that I read </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Aikido-Dynamic-Sphere-Illustrated-Introduction/dp/0804832846"><span

              style="font-size:14"> by Westbrook and O'Ratti. It was fascinating
              to me. I really wanted to practice, but there was no place near me
              in NJ where I could at the time.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp; When I think about it, I can relate a lot to what
              Mark Salzman wrote about in "</span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0679767789/103-4084270-5397466?v=glance"><span

              his early martial arts aspirations.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp; At college, I think I practiced martial arts more
              than I studied, and I did quite a bit of studying. I had a full
              course load of 20 or more credit hours every semester, but I still
              found time to work part time (12 hours a week) as an intern, and
              spend about 8-12 hours a week practicing karate and aikido. At
              first, I just practiced Isshinryui Karate under Sensei Andrew
              Fleming in the basement of the armory (at RPI), but by my junior
              year I discovered the </span><a href="http://albanyaikido.com/"><span

                style="font-size:14">Capital District Aikikai</span></a><span style="font-size:14">
              in Albany. I really enjoyed it there. Sensei Irvin Faust and the
              other advanced students were top notch practitioners and teachers.
              It was the first time that I had the opportunity to practice what
              I had seen in the Westbrook &amp; O'Ratti book so many years
              before. In my spare time I also helped my friend Bob Potash teach
              Hapkido to a group of about 20 children in the married student
              dorms. This was a pretty intense couple of years. <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp; I remember when I first visited Andrew Fleming's
              Isshinryu Karate Klub in the basement of the armory as a new
              college freshman. He took a look at all the kata that I had
              learned over the last 5 years and promptly demoted me back to
              white belt. I later found out that it was not uncommon for new
              students to have black belt ranks from elsewhere and start over
              when joining. I was a little disappointed, but I decided to stick
              with it, and I'm glad I did. The only alternative there at the
              time was judo and tae kwon do, but I really liked Sensei Fleming's
              style. I learned a lot in the 4 years that I was there, and earned
              a black belt by the time I graduated. It was during this time that
              I learned a lot about sparring and got together with advanced
              sudents in the club to spar whenever I could.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp; I went to a few tournaments during this time and got
              familiar with how they were run. I never did all that well at
              these tournaments. A few times I got disqualified for excessive
              contact, even though I didn't think it was excessive, and we had
              headgear on. Although one time I did punch a guy in the throat by
              accident and he made a lot of gurglng noises. I still think it was
              an act to get the judges to disqualify me. In the kata
              competition, I got a feeling that you didn't win unless you really
              competed often and they got to know you, but maybe I just felt
              that way because I didn't win very often. We had one guy in our
              club who was ranked as a white belt, but I'm pretty sure he had a
              black belt in Tae Kwon Do. At the tournament, I was not surprised
              to learn that he had earned first place in the white belt
              division. I think it is harder to fight in the white belt division
              than the brown belt division because there are usually about 10
              times as many competitors. One time I won second place in the
              sparring only because there were 3 competitors, and I did not have
              to fight the best guy first.&nbsp; In point fighting, I think it
              is better to be the light guy in the heavy division because you
              can move faster. If you are fighting full contact, then you want
              to be the heavy guy in the light division. At 165 pounds I was
              right at the cut off between heavy and light.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp; In graduale school at UC Davis, I practiced at Aikido
              of Livermore with Sensei Jim Alvarez. A few years later I moved to
              Fremont and continued at Aiki Zenshin in Fremont - where I am now.
              For one quarter, I was at UC Davis and practiced with Jeff
              Greenberg and George Koch on campus. I also took gymnastics while
              I was there and learned how to do a forward handspring, but I
              almost broke my kneck trying to do a backwards handspring. My
              father always told me that at 6' I was too tall to be a gymnast.
              It was great to hear Jeff's stories of brutality from having
              practiced with Chiba Sensei in Southern CA. On Sundays, I
              occasionally went to Berkeley for "Sunday Sparring" at Bakers Tae
              Kwon Do. This was an interesting event where martial artists from
              anywhere and any style got together to beat the stuffing out of
              each other for a $2 entrance fee. I met some really exceptional
              martial artists there. I'm afraid to go there these days as I
              think I break now more easily than I used to. <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp; I went to a lot of Aikido seminars in my 20's. My
              favorite seminar instructors are Kanai, Shibata, Ikeda, Peter
              Bernath, Claude Berthiame, and Yamada. I remember one time when I
              was just starting out, I went to a seminar in Connecticut with
              Juba and Shibata Senseis. I went with 2 hapkido black belts who
              had no aikido training. For some dumb reason we forgot to bow when
              we got on the mat, we got a real tongue lashing from Juba Sensei.
              I thought he might beat us with a stick. Surprisingly we were
              still allowed to practice, and had a good time.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp; Now that I am older, my interest in the martial arts
              is mainly academic. I no longer have the same interest in watching
              martial arts movies that I used to. I got my aikido black belt
              in 1996, but don't really feel the need to pursue
              higher rank. I've learned that you do not need higher rank to
              continue learning, and also that it is possible to get a high rank
              without having learned. I continue to practice aikido because I
              enjoy it, it gives me exercise, provides balance to my life,
              allows me to interact with a lot of great people, and provides me
              peace of mind through a form of moving meditation. I am actually a
              bit skeptical about the street practicality of much of what we do
              in aikido, but there is something about the art that transcends
              the whole idea of fighting and self-defense. If you only have a
              little time and need to learn how to defend yourself, I think one
              would be better served learning karate. But if you want to really
              understand efficient body movement, and pursue the goal of being
              able to influence an attacker without the need to inflict injury,
              then aikido definitely has its place.<br>
