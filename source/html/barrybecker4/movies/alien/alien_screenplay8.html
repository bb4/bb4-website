        The creature melts through the mask.

        Kane tears at the thing with his hands.

        Dallas and Ash slip on surgical gloves. (rubber gloves)
        Presses a switch, Kane slides back out of the booth.

            DALLAS: <span

        Ripley takes a surgical laser blade from the case (glowstick).
        Carefully passes it to Dallas.
        He manipulates the knife until he has a comfortable grip.
        Flicks a small button with his thumb.
        The blade begins to hum. Dallas advances on Kane's prostrate form.
        Touches the scalpel to the Creature.
        The electronic blade slices effortlessly downward.
        Suddenly a urine-like fluid (apple juice) 
        begins to drip from the wound.

            DALLAS: <span
 class="dallas">Its starting to bleed.</span>

        The liquid flows onto the bedding next to Kane's head.
        Starts to (* hiss *).
        Smoke curls up from the stain.
        Next the yellow fluid eats a hole through the bunk bed.
        Then drips onto the deck below.
        Metal (* bubbling and sizzling *).
        More smoke rising, sending the crew into a coughing jag.
        The crew jostle their way out of the cabin.
        Huddle in the passageway outside, still coughing.
        Dallas frantically applies pressure to the wound.
        In the process, some of the fluid gets on Dallas's gloves.
        They begin to smoke. Dallas leaps back, pulls them off.
