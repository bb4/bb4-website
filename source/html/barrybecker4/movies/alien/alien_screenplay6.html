        Lights come on. Seven gowns hang from the wall. Vault door opens.
        Explosion of escaping gas (dry ice). The lid on a freezer pops open.
        Slowly, groggily, KANE sits up. Kane rubs the sleep from his eyes. Stands.
        Looks around. Stretches. Looks at the other freezer compartments. Scratches.

            KANE:    <span class="kane">Rise and shine, Lambert.</span>

        Another lid pops open. A young woman sits up.

               that the noise is some kind of warning.</span>

            ASH:  <span class="ash">I can't tell him anything.  I've

        He tries to open one of them.  It won't open.

            KANE: <span class="kane">Strange feeling to it.</span>

            DALLAS (voice over) <span class="dallas">
             Don't open it.  You don't know what's in it.</span>

        Kane peers closely at the leathery ovoids.       
        Raised areas begin to appear where he touched it.
        He is mesmerized by the movement. Mouth open in surprise.
        Object becoming visible within.
        Kane shines his light on the floor at the base of it.
        He studies it.

            KANE: <span class="kane">incredible...</span>

            DALLAS: <span class="dallas">(voice over) What?</span>

        Viscera and mandible now visible.
        The interior surface spongy and irregular.
        Kane shines the light inside.
        With shocking violence, a small creature smashes outward.
        Fixes itself to his mask. (*Sizzling sound*)
        The creature melts through the mask.
        Attaches itself to Kane's face.
        Kane tears at the thing with his hands.
        His mouth forced open. He falls backward.
   
<b>SCENE</b> 25: INT. OUTER CHAMBER  (platform before yellow pod)  [Dallas, Lambert]

            DALLAS: <span class="dallas">Kane...Kane can you hear me?</span>

            LAMBERT: <span class="lambert">What's the matter?</span>

            DALLAS: <span class="dallas">We better haul him out.</span>

        Dallas climbs up and hauls Kane out by his head and shoulders.
        Lambert assists. They lay him down on the platform,
        and recoil in horror at the sight of the alien thing 
        attached to his face.        

            DALLAS: <span class="dallas">What's that on his face?</span>     

        Kane appears to be completely unconscious.
        The life form is still wrapped motionless around his face.

            LAMBERT: <span class="lambert">Oh Jeez...</span>

            DALLAS: <span class="dallas">Don't touch it.</span>

        They grapple with Kane's limp body.
        Carry him out of the alien ship.
        Each has one of Kane's arms over their shoulder.

        Ripley waiting on the bridge.
        Ash stares at his inactive monitors. Suddenly:

            ASH:  <span class="ash">We've got them.  They're back on the screens.</span>
          
        Ripley presses transmitter.

            RIPLEY: <span class="ripley">Dallas, Lambert.  Can you read me?</span>

            DALLAS: (voice over)<span class="dallas">
              We hear you.  We're coming back... Kane's injured... 
              We'll need some help getting him in.</span>

        Ripley stares at the screen.

            ASH:  <span class="ash">I'll go.</span>

        Ash moves from the room. Ripley remains seated at her console.

<b>SCENE</b> 28: INT. PASSAGEWAY NEAR AIR LOCK (garage) [Ash, Parker]

        Ash comes down the steps. Hurries to the inner door lock.
        Presses the wall voice-amp. (the house speaker in Eugene's room)

            ASH:  <span class="ash">Ripley, I'm by the inner lock hatch.</span>
              
            RIPLEY: <span class="ripley">(voice over) Okay.</span>      

        Parker comes running up.

            PARKER: <span class="parker">What's going on?</span>

            ASH:  <span class="ash">Kane got hurt somehow.</span>

            PARKER: <span class="parker">How bad?</span>

        Ash shrugs.

        Ripley seated alone in the room.
        Dallas appears as a huge image on all screens.
        Lambert behind him. Kane between them.
        (pre-record outside, then show on TV)

            DALLAS: <span class="dallas"> (voice over) We're coming up.  Open the lock.</span>

        Ash hits the emergency switch (label "override"). A red light goes on.
        Servo whine. Followed by a solid metallic chunk.
        (garage door opens)

            ASH: <span class="ash">airlock hatch open.</span>

<b>SCENE</b> 31: INT. BRIDGE - NIGHT  (computer room) [Ripley]

        Ripley staring at the console. She can't believe what she sees.
        Turns to the viewscreens.
        Watches Dallas, Kane and Lambert enter.

<b>SCENE</b> 32: INT. PASSAGEWAY NEAR AIR LOCK (garage, laundry room) 
          [Ash, Parker, Dalls, Lambert, Kane]

        The servo again turns over. Another clunk.
        The outer door has closed. Red light off.
        The inner (garage) door opens.
        Dallas and Lambert stagger into passageway (laundry room).
        Carry Kane's body between them.
        Dallas pulls off his helmet.

            DALLAS: <span class="dallas">Stay clear.</span>

        Ash and Parker move back.
                
            PARKER: <span class="parker">Is it alive?</span>
       
            LAMBERT: <span class="lambert">We don't know. Don't touch it.</span>

            DALLAS: <span class="dallas">Take him to the infirmary.</span>

            PARKER: <span class="parker">Right.</span>

        Ash and Parker move in carefully to help with the limp burden.

<b>SCENE</b> 33: INT. INFIRMARY (kitchen island) [Dallas, Ash, Kane, Ripley]

        Kane's helmet. Hands begin to open it with a laser cutter.
        The helmet separates easily. (use keychain laser light)
        The two halves part...
        ...The life form slowly pulsing on Kane's face.
        Dallas hesitates, then puts his hand on the small Creature.
        Tries to pull it free. Unsuccessful.
        The Alien remains anchored to Kane's tissue.

            ASH:  <span class="ash">Let me try.</span>

        Ash takes a pair of pliers from a rack.
        Carefully grasps the tip of the Creature.
        Squeezes tightly. Leans back.

            DALLAS: <span class="dallas">You're tearing his face.</span>

        A trickle of blood appears on Kane's cheek.

            PARKER: <span class="parker">It's not going to come off without
              pulling his whole face off at the same time.</span>

            DALLAS: <span class="dallas">Let the machine work on him.</span>

        The Ash presses a switch. The machine lights up.
        Kane is sucked into a slot on the wall.
        Visible inside through the glass layer.
        A blinding colored light performs antisepsis.
        Two video monitors pop on.
        (cardboard box over head. Computer monitor turn on)  

        --- Ripley enters ---
        Dallas turns and looks at her. A long moment.

            DALLAS: <span class="dallas">When I give an order, I expect
              it to be obeyed.</span>

            RIPLEY: <span class="ripley">Even if it's against the law?</span>

            DALLAS: <span class="dallas">Yes.</span>

        Lambert steps forward and slaps Ripley across the face.
        Ripley slowly puts her hand to her cheek.

            LAMBERT: <span class="lambert">You were going to leave us out there.</span>

            PARKER: <span class="parker">Maybe she should have.  
              Who knows what that is.</span>
          
        Ripley looks at Lambert. 

            RIPLEY: <span class="ripley">Let's call it settled.</span>

        Lambert gives her a curt nod.
        ----  SCENE break --- 
        Ash turns attention to the instrumentation (laptop).

           PARKER: <span class="parker">How the heck is he breathing?</span>

        They study the monitors.

           ASH: <span class="ash">His blood is throughly oxygenated.</span>

           DALLAS: <span class="dallas">How?  His nose and mouth seem to be blocked.</span>

           ASH:  <span class="dallas">We better look inside his head.</span>

        Ash punches three buttons. An X-ray image appears.
        A color depiction of Kane's head and upper torso.
        The Alien is clearly visible. (drawing? or cg image?)
        A maze of complicated biology. Kane's jaws are forced open.
        The creature has extruded a long tube down his mouth and
        throat. The appendage ending at the base of the esophagus.

           PARKER: <span class="parker"> It's got something down his frigging throat.</span>

           ASH: That must be how it's getting oxygen to him.

           RIPLEY: <span class="ripley">It doesn't make sense.  It paralyzes
              him, puts him into a coma, then
              keeps him alive...</span>

           PARKER: <span class="parker">Let's kill it.  We can't leave the
              darn thing on him.</span>

           ASH:    <span class="ash">I don't know.  At the moment the
              Creature is keeping him alive.
              If we remove it we might kill him.</span>

           DALLAS: <span class="dallas">I don't think so.  Let's take the
              chance and cut it off him.</span>

        Dallas and Ash slip on surgical gloves. (rubber gloves)
        Presses a switch, Kane slides back out of the booth.

           DALLAS: <span class="dallas">Give me the knife.</span>
              
        Ripley takes a surgical laser blade from the case (glowstick).
        Carefully passes it to Dallas.
        He manipulates the knife until he has a comfortable grip.
        Flicks a small button with his thumb.
        The blade begins to hum. Dallas advances on Kane's prostrate form.
        Touches the scalpel to the Creature.
        The electronic blade slices effortlessly downward.
        Suddenly a urine-like fluid (apple juice) 
        begins to drip from the wound.

            DALLAS: <span class="dallas">Its starting to bleed.</span>

        The liquid flows onto the bedding next to Kane's head.
        Starts to (* hiss *).
        Smoke curls up from the stain.
        Next the yellow fluid eats a hole through the bunk bed.
        Then drips onto the deck below.
        Metal (* bubbling and sizzling *).
        More smoke rising, sending the crew into a coughing jag.
        The crew jostle their way out of the cabin.
        Huddle in the passageway outside, still coughing.
        Dallas frantically applies pressure to the wound.
        In the process, smoke of the fluid gets on Dallas's gloves.
        They begin to smoke. Dallas leaps back, pulls them off.
        Then runs out into the corridor.

            PARKER: <span class="parker">Shoot!  I hope it doesn't burn through the hull...</span>
              
        He starts to run for the companionway. Ash goes with him.      
        Ripley and Parker move cautiously down the passageway.
        Look up to the ceiling bulkhead.

            RIPLEY: <span class="ripley">What's happening?</span>

            ASH: (voice over)  <span class="ash">
              The acid made to C level.
              I think it's lost steam now. No longer active.

              except molecular acid...</span>

            PARKER: <span class="parker">(voice over) and this thing uses it for blood.</span>
         
            DALLAS: <span class="dallas">Wonderful defense mechanism.
                   You don't dare kill it.</span>

            RIPLEY: <span class="ripley">Let's go back and check on Kane?</span>
   
<b>SCENE</b> 35:  INT. INFIRMARY  (kithen island) [Dallas, Ash, Ripley]

        They return. Kane still motionless on the bunk.
        However, the Alien is no longer on his face.        
        Dallas approaches, peers at Kane's head.

            DALLAS: <span class="dallas"> It's gone.</span>

        Kane's prone form.
        The Alien is no longer on his face.
        Kane still unconscious, but continues to breathe.
        Face covered with sucker marks (use lipstick).

            RIPLEY: <span class="ripley"> The door was closed.  It must still
              be in here.</span>

            RIPLEY: <span class="ripley">Yeah, I remember.  We can't grab
             it.  We can't kill it...</span>
     
        Dallas begins moving slowly around the room.
        Picking up a stainless steel tray. Looking.
        Ash and Ripley do the same.
        Ripley bends down and peers under the bunk. Nothing.
        She stands. Doesn't see the Alien on a ledge above her.
        Her shoulder brushes against the Creature.
        It drops on her. She screams.  Twists.
        The Alien drops to the floor. Then lies motionless.
        Its skin faded to a dead-looking grey.
        Ripley doesn't raise her eyes from the Creature.
        Ash prods the Alien. No response.

            ASH: <span class="ash">It's dead. (looks to Ripley) You okay?</span>

            RIPLEY: <span class="ripley">Yeah.</span>

        She carefully touches the Creature with a metal probe.
        Fishes the motionless life-form into the tray.
        Quickly closes the lid.
        Lifts it onto a stainless steel table.
        Bright light trained on the Alien.
        The Creature in a supine position.
        Ash touches the Alien with a surgical instrument.
     
            RIPLEY: <span class="ripley">Let's get rid of it.</span>
   
            ASH:   <span class="ash">This has to go back.  This is our first contact with a

            DALLAS: <span class="dallas">You're the science officer.  It's your decision.</span>

            ASH:    <span class="ash">Then it's made... I'll seal it in a stasis tube.</span>
 
            RIPLEY: <span class="ripley">What about Kane?</span>

        Ash turns back to the bunk.
        Studies the life support gauges.
        Kane continues to breathe steadily.

            ASH: <span class="ash">He's Running a fever.  And still unconscious.  
              Mother will bring his temperature down.
              Who knows, he may make it.</span>

        Ash begins to seal the Alien in a large vacuum tube.
        (large tuperware container)

           RIPLEY: <span class="ripley">I need some coffee.</span>

            DALLAS: <span class="dallas">How far to Earth.</span>

            LAMBERT: <span class="lambert">Four months.</span>

            RIPLEY: <span class="ripley">Crud...</span>

        (* Beep *).

            DALLAS: <span class="dallas">Dallas.</span>

            ASH:  (voice over) 
                  <span class="ash">Come and see Kane right away...</span>

        Dallas, Ripley, Lambert exit headed toward infirmary.

<b>SCENE</b> 43:  INT. INFIRMARY   [Lambert, Kane, Ash, Dallas, Parker]

        What they see is...Not what they expect.
        Kane is sitting up in bed...wide awake.
        They enter...

            LAMBERT: <span class="lambert">Kane...Are you all right?</span>

            KANE: <span class="kane">Mouth's dry...can I have some water.</span>

        Instantly, Ash brings him a plastic cup and water.
        Kane gulps it down in a swallow.

            DALLAS: <span class="dallas">How do you feel?</span>

            KANE: <span class="kane">Terrible.  What happened to me?</span>

            ASH: <span class="ash">You don't remember?</span>

            KANE: <span class="kane">Don't remember anything.  I can barely remember my name.</span>

            PARKER: <span class="parker">Do you hurt?</span>

            KANE: <span class="kane">All over.  Feel like somebody's 
             been beaten me with a stick. (smiles) I'm so hungry.</span>

            PARKER: <span class="parker">We're Getting ready to go back into the freezers.</span>

            KANE: <span class="kane">I'm starving.  I want some food first.</span>

            DALLAS: <span class="dallas">One meal before bed.</span>

<b>SCENE</b> 44: INT. MESS  [All]

        The entire crew is seated.
        Hungrily swallowing huge portions of artificial food.
        (colord mashed potatoes, gasses of water in plastic cups, etc)
        The bear eats from a dish on the table.

            KANE: <span class="kane">  First thing I'm going to do when
               we get back is eat some decent food.</span>

            LAMBERT: <span class="lambert">Jeez, you're pounding down this
               stuff like there's no tomorrow.</span>

        Pause. Suddenly Kane grimaces.

            RIPLEY: <span class="ripley">What's wrong?</span>

        Kane's voice strains.

            LAMBERT: <span class="lambert">What's the matter?</span>

            KANE: <span class="kane">I don't know... I'm getting cramps.</span>
   
        The others stare at him in alarm.
        Suddenly he makes a loud groaning noise.
        Clutches the edge of the table with his hands.
        Knuckles whitening.

            ASH:  <span class="ash">Breathe deeply.</span>

        Kane screams.

            KANE: <span class="kane">Oh God, it hurts so bad.
             It hurts.  It hurts.
                   (stands up)
             Ooooooh.</span>

            PARKER: <span class="parker">What is it?  What hurts?</span>

        Kane's face screws into a mask of agony.
        He falls back into his chair.

            KANE: <span class="kane">Ohmygooaaaahh!</span>

        A red stain. Then a smear of blood blossoms on his chest.
        The fabric of his shirt is ripped apart.
        A small head the size of a man's fist pushes out.
        The crew shouts in panic. Leap back from the table.
        The cat spits, bolts away. The tiny head lunges forward.
        Comes spurting out of Kane's chest trailing a thick body.
        Splatters fluids and blood in its wake.
        Lands in the middle of the dishes and food.
        Wriggles away while the crew scatters.
        Then the Alien being disappears from sight.
        Kane lies slumped in his chair. Very dead.
        A huge hole in his chest.
        The dishes are scattered.
        Food covered with blood.

           LAMBERT: <span class="lambert">No! ... no, no, no.</span>

           PARKER: <span class="parker">What was that?  What the frig was that?</span>

           RIPLEY: <span class="ripley">It was growing in him the whole
              time and he didn't even know it.</span>

           ASH:  <span class="ash">It used him for an incubator.</span>
        
           DALLAS: <span class="dallas">Looks like we've got another one...
              And it's loose on the ship.</span>

        Slowly they gather around Kane's gutted corpse.
        Then they all look at one another.
        Then at Kane. Dead on the table.

<b>SCENE</b> 45: INT. CORRIDOR - "A" DECK  (foyer) [Dallas, Ripley, Ash, Lambert, Parker]

        Empty.   Parker descends companioway.
        He joins Ash, Lambert, Ripley and Dallas.

           DALLAS: <span class="dallas">Any signs?</span>

           LAMBERT: <span class="lambert">Nothing.</span>
       
           RIPLEY: <span class="ripley">We can't go into hypersleep with that thing running loose.  
              We'd be sitting ducks in the freezers.
              We have to kill it first.</span>

           LAMBERT: <span class="lambert">We can't kill it.  If we do, it
               will spill its body acids right through the hull...</span>

           RIPLEY: <span class="ripley">We have to catch it and eject it from the ship.</span>

           ASH:   <span class="ash">Our supplies are based on us spending a limited 
             amount of time out of suspended animation.</span>
                  
           RIPLEY: <span class="ripley">First we have to find it.</span>

           DALLAS: <span class="dallas"> No.  First we've got dispose of Kane's body.</span>

        He looks at Kane's body through mess doorway.

<b>SCENE</b> 46: INT. AIR LOCK (garage) [Kane]

        Kane's body wrapped in a makeshift shroud.      

<b>SCENE</b> 47: INT. BRIDGE    [All]

        The crew looking at Kane's body on view screens.
        (show on TV) Silent. Depressed. 

            DALLAS: <span class="dallas">Anybody want to say anything?</span>

        Nothing to say. He nods to Ripley.
        She presses a button. The outer hatch opens.
        Yawning space outside.
        Kane's body shoots out into eternity.
        (animate acceleration with stop motion photography)
        The hatch closes.

<b>SCENE</b> 48: INT. MESS  (kitchen table)  [All but Kane]

        The crew is assembled. Mess is clean again.

            RIPLEY: <span class="ripley">I've checked on the supplies.
               We can stay out of hypersleep for about a week.</span>

            LAMBERT: <span class="lambert">Then We run out oxygen.</span>

            DALLAS: <span class="dallas">All right, that's what we've got.
               A week.  It's enough.</span>
          
            RIPLEY: <span class="ripley">How do we find it?  There's no visual 
               communication on B and C decks.</span> 

            DALLAS: <span class="dallas">We're going to have to flush it out.
               Room by room, corridor by corridor.</span>
       
<b>SCENE</b> 49: INT. INFIRMARY   [Dallas, Ash]

        Dallas enters.
        Ash working at a read-out section (on laptop).

            DALLAS: <span class="dallas">I want to talk.</span>
                          
            ASH:    <span class="ash">Im a little busy...</span>
 
            DALLAS: <span class="dallas">Why did you let the Alien survive
              inside Kane?</span>

            ASH:    <span class="ash">What do you mean?</span>

            DALLAS: <span class="dallas">Mother was monitoring his body.
               You were monitoring Mother.  
               You must have had some idea of what was going on.</span>

            ASH:    <span class="ash">What are you trying to say?</span>   

            DALLAS: <span class="dallas">You want the Alien to stay alive
               ...I figure you have a reason.</span>
   
            ASH:   <span class="ash">I don't know what you're talking about.  
              The Alien is a dangerous form of life...
              I don't want it to stay alive any more than you do.</span>

            DALLAS: <span class="dallas">You're sure?</span>

            ASH:    <span class="ash">Yeah, I'm sure.</span>

        Dallas walks out. Ash watches him go.
        Stares in his direction a long while...   
      
<b>SCENE</b> 50:   INT. BRIDGE   (computer room)  [All but Kane] 

        The crew has assembled.
        Brett unfolds several yards of asbestos netting.
        Hands out five thin rods.
        Each of them like metal broom handles (light sabers).

            PARKER: <span class="parker">I put portable generators in each of these.  
              They're insulated down here.  
              Just be dang careful not to get your hand on the end.</span>

        He touches the tip to a metal object. A blue (*spark*) leaps.

            LAMBERT: <span class="lambert">Great. Now if we could only find it.</span>

        Ash picks up a portable unit.

            ASH:   <span class="ash">I've taken care of that. This is a tracking device.  
              It hasn't much range but when you get within
              a certain distance it starts beeping.</span>

        Ripley takes the tracker (laser tag gun) from Ash's hand.
   
            DALLAS: <span class="dallas">We'll break into two teams.
               Whoever finds it first catches it in the net and ejects
               it from the nearest air lock.
                    (pause)
               For starters, let's make sure the bridge is safe.</span>

        Parker turns on his unit.  Scans it around the room.

<b>SCENE</b> 51:  INT. PASSAGEWAY - "A" LEVEL  [Lambert, Dallas, Ash]

        Lambert and Dallas carry the net.
        Ash walks directly behind, carrying the tracking device.
        He continually scans from side to side.
        Lambert stops by a stairwell.

            LAMBERT: <span class="lambert">Anything down there?</span>

<b>SCENE</b> 52: INT. ANOTHER PASSAGEWAY - "B" LEVEL  [Ripley, Parker]

        Parker and Ripley move silently along.
        Ripley ahead of them with the tracker by the stairwell.

            RIPLEY: <span class="ripley">Nothing.</span>

        They move on. A small light flashes.

            RIPLEY: <span class="ripley">Hold it.  I've got something.</span>

        Parker grows tense.
        Start looking around.

            PARKER: <span class="parker">Where's it coming from?</span>

        Ripley peers closely at the tracker.
      
            RIPLEY: <span class="ripley">Over there.</span>

        Looks at the tracker.
        Nods down the passageway. 
        They begin to walk in that direction.
        Entering drab section of the ship.
        Surrounded by deep shadows.
        Footsteps clanging on the metal deck.
       
            RIPLEY: <span class="ripley">Wait.</span>

        They stop quickly, almost stumbling.

            RIPLEY: <span class="ripley">It's within two meters.</span>

        Parker hefts the net.
        Ripley has the prod in one hand, tracker in the other.
        Moves with great care.
        Almost in a half-crouch, ready to leap back.
        Prod extended, Ripley constantly glances at her tracker.
        The device leads her up to a small hatch in the bulkhead.
        Perspiration rivers down her face. She sets aside the tracker.
        Raises the prod, grasps the hatch handle. Yanks it open.
        Jams the electric prod inside. A nerve-shattering squall.
        Then a small creature comes flying out of the locker.
        Eyes glaring, claws flashing.
        Instinctively, they throw the net over it.
        They open the net and release the captive.
        Which happens to be the bear (Tippy Tip).
        Hissing and spitting...it scampers away.

           PARKER: <span class="parker">Darn. We should have boxed it...Now
               we might pick it up on the tracker again.</span>

           RIPLEY: <span class="ripley">Go get it. I'll go on.</span>
               
        Ripley moves down the passageway.
        Parker follows the direction taken by the cat.
        Moves across passageway into equipment maintenance area.
   
<b>SCENE</b> 53: INT. EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE AREA - "C" LEVEL  [Parker]
   
        Parker walking between rows of shadowed equipment.
        Looking for the cat. Nervous.

            PARKER: <span class="parker">Jones...Here bear...Jones...
              Gosh darn it Jones.</span>

        Scratching noises. A reassuring bear yowl.
        Parker enters storage room. Still looking for Jones.
        Another yowl followed by a hiss.
        Two eyes shining in the dark. Jones.
        Relieved, Parker moves toward the bear.

            PARKER: <span class="parker">Here bear...Come on Jones.</span>
   
        Parker reaches for Jones. Jones growls.
        An **Alien** arm reaches for Parker. The Alien.
        Now seven feet tall.
        Hanging from the undercarriage strut in reverse position.
        Grabs Parker and swings up into darkness.
        Parker screams. To no avail...
        In the doorway Ripley. She witnesses the horror.

<b>SCENE</b> 54: INT. MESS  (kitchen table) [Lambert, Ripley, Dallas, Ash]

        The remaining crew assemble. Long faces.

            LAMBERT: <span class="lambert">Now what?</span>
        
            RIPLEY: <span class="ripley"> We can't shoot it.
                At its present size it's holding enough acid to 
                tear a hole in this ship as big as this room.</span>

            ASH:     <span class="ash">According to Mother, he's a primitive form of encephalopod...</span>
   
            LAMBERT: <span class="lambert">How come it's a he?</span>

            ASH:     <span class="ash">As a matter of fact he's both, bisexual or
                hermaphrodite to be precise.</span>
   
            DALLAS: <span class="dallas"> Skip its sex life.  How do we kill it?</span>

            ASH:    <span class="ash">It seems to have adapted to this environment.
               The only thing we don't know about is temperature.</span>

            RIPLEY: <span class="ripley">All right.  What about fire?</span>

            ASH:   <span class="ash">Let's give it a try.  Most animals retreat from fire.
              I will hook up a couple of incinerating units.</span>
      
            DALLAS: <span class="dallas">Anybody got any better ideas?</span>

        Nobody does.
     
<b>SCENE</b> 55:  EXT. OUTER SPACE  [nobody]

        Nostromo at light plus four.

<b>SCENE</b> 56: INT. PASSAGEWAY - "B" LEVEL  [Dallas, Lambert]

        Dallas and Lambert lead. Armed with flamethrowers.
        They descend from companionway.
        Suddenly both tracking devices beep frantically.
        (*Sound of rending metal*) up ahead. They move forward cautiously.
   
           DALLAS: <span class="dallas">It's in that food locker.</span>

        outside FOOD LOCKER NUMBER 7 More (*rending noises*).

           LAMBERT: <span class="lambert"> Jeez. It must be huge.</span>

           DALLAS: <span class="dallas">It's got to be using the airshafts to move around...</span>

        Dallas raises flamethrower. Dallas indicates door handle.
        Lambert reluctantly takes it.

           DALLAS: <span class="dallas">Now!</span>

        Lambert wrenches open door. Dallas fires a long blast.  Another.
        Another and another...Silence. They move inside...

<b>SCENE</b> 57: INT. FOOD STORAGE LOCKER NUMBER 7 - "B" LEVEL  [Ripley, Dallas, Lambert]

        Charred wreckage. Packages have been ripped to shreds.
        Foodstuffs scattered over the floor.
        Carefully, they poke through the smouldering garbage.
   
           RIPLEY: <span class="ripley">We didn't get him.</span>
      
           DALLAS: <span class="dallas">This is where he went.</span>

        On the wall, a ventilator grill has been ripped open.
        They move to the shredded ventilator.
        Shine their lights inside the shaft.

            DALLAS: <span class="dallas">This could work for us.  
               The duct comes out at the air lock.  
               There's an exit on the way, but we can close that off.  
               Then we drive it into the air lock and blast it into space.</span>

            LAMBERT: <span class="lambert"> Yeah.  All you have to do is
               crawl in the vent with it, and hope it's afraid of fire.</span>                      
           
            DALLAS: <span class="dallas">Ripley, you take the air lock.  
               Ash and Lambert cover the exit.</span>

<b>SCENE</b> 58: INT. STARBOARD AIR LOCK - VESTIBULE (Eugenes room) [Ripley]

        Ripley stands in vestibule. Looks through the Bulkhead door to air lock.
        She throws a switch.
        Watches airshaft entrance into air lock open. The trap is ready.
        
            RIPLEY: <span class="ripley">Air lock open.</span>

<b>SCENE</b> 59: INT. MAINTENANCE LEVEL   [Ash, Lambert]

        Ash and Lambert get set. A large rectangular duct in one wall.
        Ash hefts his flamethrower.

            ASH:  <span class="ash">That's where it's got to come
              out, if it leaves the main shaft.</span>
                       
            DALLAS: <span class="dallas"> (voice over)
               Ash, if it tries to come out by you, make sure you drive

            ASH: <span class="ash">Right.</span>

<b>SCENE</b> 60: INT. FOOD STORAGE LOCKER NUMBER 12 - "B" LEVEL
       
        Dallas fires a couple of short bursts.

           DALLAS: <span class="dallas">It's still working.</span>

        Dallas turns and climbs into the ventilator opening.
        Just large enough to crawl through.

<b>SCENE</b> 61: INT. AIR SHAFT           [Dallas]

        Dallas begins to crawl forward. The tunnel is narrow...
        Only a foot or two wider than his shoulders.
   
           DALLAS: <span class="dallas">I'm under way.</span>

        Turns a corner. Several more tight turns.
        Ahead the shaft takes an abrupt downward turn.
        He moves toward the corner.
        Fires another blast from the flamethrower.
        Then starts crawling down, head first.

<b>SCENE</b> 62: INT. EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE AREA   [Lambert, Ash]

        Lambert sees something on the tracker.
   
           LAMBERT: <span class="lambert">Beginning to get a reading on you.</span>                                           

<b>SCENE</b> 63:  INT. AIR SHAFT   [Dallas]

        Dallas against a wall of the shaft.
        Clutching his flamethrower.
        Whispers into his throat mike.

            DALLAS: <span class="dallas">I don't think this shaft goes
               much farther... It's getting hot in here.</span>

        Moves forward.  Reaches a repair junction. Sits.
        His feet dangle beneath the catwalk floor to the next level.
                      
            DALLAS: <span class="dallas">Lambert, what kind of reading
               are you getting?</span>

            LAMBERT: (voice over) <span class="lambert">
               I'm not sure.  There seems to be some kind of double image.</span>

        Dallas sitting.
        His feet still dangling in the dark beneath the catwalk.

            DALLAS: <span class="dallas">It may be interference.  I'll push on ahead.</span>

        Dallas begins to rise.
        From below, a gentle movement toward the hanging feet.
        A hand reaches up. Misses his leg as Dallas moves ahead.

            DALLAS: <span class="dallas">Lambert, am I coming in any clearer?</span>

            LAMBERT: (voice over)<span class="lambert">  
              It's clear all right, but I'm
              still getting two blips.
                    (pause)
              I'm not sure which one is you.</span>

        Dallas stops. Turns around. Looks back down through the catwalk.
        Lowers the nose of the flamethrower, his finger on the trigger.
        From behind him, the hand reaches up. The Alien was the front signal.

<b>SCENE</b> 65: INT. AIR LOCK VESTIBULE

        Ripley bends forward. Hears the sounds of the struggle...
        And Dallas' screams. She cries out.

          RIPLEY: (voice over)
             <span class="ripley"> Dallas... Dallas...</span>


<b>SCENE</b> 66: INT. MESS  (kitcehn table)    [Ripley, Ash, Lambert]

        Dallas' flamethrower on the table surface.

            LAMBERT: (voice over)<span class="lambert"> 
                We just found it laying there. No sign of him.  
                Only a hole torn through to the central cooling complex.</span>

        The remaining crew standing at the table.

            RIPLEY: <span class="ripley">This puts me in command.</span>
             
        Ripley turns to Ash.

           RIPLEY: <span class="ripley">Any ideas?  From you or Mother?</span>

           ASH:   <span class="ash">Nothing new.</span> 

           RIPLEY: <span class="ripley"> You mean to tell me with everything we've got,
               we're still powerless against the Beast?</span>

           ASH:    <span class="ash">That's the way it looks.</span>

           RIPLEY: <span class="ripley">OK. Go refuel the weapons.</span>         
      
        Ash nods and leaves.

           RIPLEY: <span class="ripley">I think Ash is Lying. He knows more.</span>

           LAMBERT: <span class="lambert">Why should he lie?</span>

           RIPLEY: <span class="ripley">Just a feeling I have.</span>

        Lambert shrugs. They start to leave.

<b>SCENE</b> 67:  INT. COMPUTER ANNEX  (Computer room)  [Ripley, Ash, Lambert]

        (private voice dialog between Ripley and mother)        
        Data banks come to life. She sits at a console.
        Thinks for a moment. Then punches up a code.
        Nothing happens. Punches another combination.
        Nothing happens. Frustration.
        Another combination. One screen comes to life.    
           
            MOTHER: Hello Captain.
            RIPLEY: <span class="ripley"> Is Ash protecting the Alien?</span>
            MOTHER:  Yes
            RIPLEY: <span class="ripley"> Why?</span>
            MOTHER:  SPECIAL ORDER 937. SCIENCE EYE'S ONLY.
            
        Ripley starts a new code.  
        A hand slams down next to Ripley's arm.
        She whips around in her chair. Faces Ash.
        Ripley lashes out with her foot.
        Kicks him in the middle. No effect. Ripley twists away.
        Ash throws a punch at her. Misses. She pushes a chair at him.
        Overturns the desk...
        And runs through bridge into Mess hall.

        He moves after her. Gets her.     
        Lambert bursts into the Mess hall.
        Lambert falls on Ash's back. Ash turns to Lambert.
        Tosses her across the room. Returns to Ripley.
        Again choking her. Lambert lifts the tracker.
        Steps behind Ash. Swings the tracker...Wallop.
        Tears his head off...
        Wires ascending from Ash's trunk.
        Where his head used to be.
        Ash's hands release Ripley.
        Search above his neck for his missing head. He walks backward.
        All eyes on Ash's headless body. He walks the room.
        Still feeling for his missing head.
   
           LAMBERT: <span class="lambert">A robot, a frigging Droid...</span>

        Ash turns on him. Starts to advance.
        Lambert hits him again with the tracker...
        Again. Again. No avail.
        Ash begins choking Lambert.
        Ripley picks up one of the prod sticks.
        Closes on Ash's back. Tears away the fabric.
        Ripley tears at the controls buried in the cavity once
        covered by his head.
        Lamberts's eyes bulge in pain.
        Ash, headless, choking, choking, choking...
        Ripley finds the wires, stabs the prod home...
        Ash's grip lessens. Another stab...electrical flash...
        The grip lessens...
        Another stab...flash of circuits.
        The headless body collapses.
        Lambert trying to regain his breath.
   
           LAMBERT: <span class="lambert">Darn you.</span>

        Kicks the headless body. Lambert looks at Ripley.

           LAMBERT: <span class="lambert">Tell me...What the heck's going on?</span>

           RIPLEY: <span class="ripley">Let's find out.  Wire him back up.</span>

           LAMBERT: <span class="lambert">Are you kidding?</span>

           RIPLEY: <span class="ripley"> Do it.</span>

        They set to work.
        Begin to reassemble the wiring in Ash's head.
            
<b>SCENE</b> 68:  MESS  (Kitchen table)  [Ripley, Ash, Lambert]
        
        Ash's head is placed on the table.
        (Head through hole in cardboard in middle of table)
        His eyes flicker into consciousness.
   
            RIPLEY: <span class="ripley">What is Special Order 937?</span>

            ASH:  <span class="ash">You know I can't tell you that.</span>

            RIPLEY: <span class="ripley"> Then there's not point in talking
                     to you.  Pull the plug.</span>

            ASH:   <span class="ash">Special Order 937 asked me to direct the ship
                   to the planet, investigate a life form, 
                   and bring it back for observation. </span> 

            RIPLEY: <span class="ripley">Why not tell us?</span>

            ASH:     <span class="ash">Would you have gone?</span>

            LAMBERT: <span class="lambert">It wasn't in the contract.</span>

            ASH:     <span class="ash">My very point.</span>

            LAMBERT: <span class="lambert">Those jerks.</span>

            RIPLEY: <span class="ripley"> How do we kill it?</span>

            ASH:  I don't think you can.  But I might be able to.

            RIPLEY: <span class="ripley">How?</span>

            ASH:  <span class="ash">I don't know quite yet.  
                  I'm not exactly at my best at the moment.
                  If you would reconnect...</span>

            RIPLEY: <span class="ripley">No way. We've had enough of your help.</span>
            
        Ripley pulls the plug and exits to the bridge.

<b>SCENE</b> 69:  INT. BRIDGE  (computer room)  [Ripley, Lambert]

        Ripley in the Computer Annex.
        Lambert enters.

           RIPLEY: <span class="ripley"> We've got less than twelve hours oxygen left.</span>

           LAMBERT: <span class="lambert">It's all over.</span>              

           RIPLEY: <span class="ripley">I think we should leave in the shuttle 
                   and then blow up the ship.</span>

<b>SCENE</b> 70:  INT. AIR LOCK - NARCISSUS

        Ripley, and Lambert loading oxygen tanks onto 
        the Narcissus (shuttle).

            RIPLEY: <span class="ripley"> That's all the oxygen.
                     Now let's get the food, shut off the engines and get out...
                     Jones.  Where's Jones?</span>

            LAMBERT: <span class="lambert">Who knows.
                     Last I saw him was in the mess.</span>

            RIPLEY: <span class="ripley">I'll Go look.  We don't want to leave him.</span>

            LAMBERT: <span class="lambert">Hurry I don't want to be alone here.</span>

        They move out.

<b>SCENE</b> 72: INT. BRIDGE  [Ripley]

        Jones lying on Dallas' computer console.
        Ripley comes in. Smiles.

            RIPLEY: <span class="ripley"> Jones.  You're in luck.</span>

        As she reaches for him, Jones jumps off the console.
        Moves away.

            RIPLEY: <span class="ripley"> Come on, Jones.</span>

        She moves after the bear.
        We hear Lambert over the communicator
        from the coolant locker.

            RIPLEY: <span class="ripley">Here little bear...come here now...</span>

        The tracker flashes faster. Now it's noticed.
        Lamber drops the food and picks up the flamethrower.
      
           LAMBERT: <span class="lambert">Ripley, get back here.</span>
                          
        The Alien appears out of the air shaft ventilator.
        Lambert turns. Screams. Unfolding, the Alien grabs for her.

<b>SCENE</b> 74:  INT. BRIDGE        [Ripley]

        Ripley freezes as she hears Lambert's screams
        Ripley listening on the communicator.
        Lambert's dying shrieks.
        Then the voice-amp goes dead. Silence.

           RIPLEY: <span class="ripley">Lambert?...</span>

        She waits for a response.
        But her expression shows that she expects none.
        A long moment. Expectation fulfilled.     
        Ripley descends, cautiously, holding flamethrower
        and Jones in pressurized box.

        The Narcissus berthed beyond.
        She drags Jones and raises the flamethrower.
        Turns to see if the Creature is behind her.
        Then advances down the passageway.
        Goaded on by the computer.

            MOTHER: Attention. The engines will explode in ninety seconds.

        Ripley frantically straps herself in.
        G-forces from the shuttles acceleration pulling against her.

        Ripley finishes strapping herself in.
        Reaches and grabs the bear box. The bear yowling within.

        Hunches her head down over the container.

<b>SCENE</b> 78: EXT. SPACE   [nobody]

        The Nostromo drifts farther away from the shuttle-craft.
        Finally becomes a small point of light. Then it blows up.
        Transforms into expanding orange fireball.
        Pieces of metal flying in all directions.
        And then the refinery explodes.
        200,000,000 tons of fuel blasting silently into the cosmos.

<b>SCENE</b> 79: INT. NARCISSUS  (Avalon) [Ripley]

        The shockwave hits the shuttle craft.
        Jolting and rattling everything within. Then all is quiet.        
        She looks out the side window. Face bathed in orange light.
        Then, behind her, the lethal hand emerges from deep shadow.  
        The Alien has been in the shuttle-craft all along.
        The bear yowls. Ripley whirls.
        Finding herself facing the **Alien**.
        Ripley's smashes the alien on the head with the flamethrower.

        Ripley is seated in the control chair.
        Calm and composed, almost cheerful. Jone in her lap.
